talks:

- title: Introduction to OpenStack
  speaker: Rich Bowen
  start: 2015-02-21 11:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-21 11:30 PDT
  description: |
    You've seen Cloud in the press for years, and you have a pretty good
    idea of what that means, but what's OpenStack? In this talk, you'll
    get the high-level view of what OpenStack is, what all the moving
    parts do, and how they fit together. We'll also talk about the
    OpenStack Foundation, and how the project is governed.

    Topics covered will include:

    * The various parts of the stack
    * How they communicate with one another
    * How to spin up an OpenStack private cloud
    * How the OpenStack Foundation operates, and a brief history of the project
    * How to get involved in the OpenStack project
    * What the alternate cloud infrastructure platforms are

- title: Solving the Package Problem (Or Making It Infinitely Worse?)
  speaker: Joe Brockmeier
  start: 2015-02-21 13:30 PDT

    We've come a long, long way since the days of installing software by
    compiling source nd shoving it onto a system with `make install`.
    Last year, Docker containers were heralded as a way out of the
    complexities of managing software - but today we're faced with
    a slew of container offerings and things look more complex than
    ever. What's the solution? In this presentation we'll look at
    a number of next-generation technologies for managing applications,
    such as:

    * OStree/rpm-ostree
    * Software Collections
    * Docker, Rocket, and LXC
    * dnf

    We'll talk about the options in front of developers and admins
    today, how they can navigate all the new shiny technologies that
    promise better software delivery and management, and what the rest
    of 2015 is likely to bring.

- title: Solving (NP-Hard) Scheduling Problems with oVirt and OptaPlanner
  speaker: Jason Brooks
  start: 2015-02-21 18:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-21 19:00 PDT
  description: |
    Certain scheduling tasks, such as selecting the host to launch a new
    VM or receive a migrating VM, are central to every cloud and
    virtualization management system. These systems use rules to make
    scheduling decisions, but rules alone leave certain efficiency gains
    unrealized. Version 3.5 of oVirt, the open source virtual datacenter
    management system, included a new VM scheduling optimizer based on
    the OptaPlanner project. While working within policy constraints set
    by an administrator, this service performs probabalistic analysis of
    the environment to suggest how best to assign host resources.

    In this talk, learn about:

    * The machine reassignment problem and how it relates to oVirt
    * What OptaPlanner is and how it addresses the problem
    * How the oVirt project developed and integrated this functionality
    * Future directions for the feature
    * Applicability of this technology in other project

- title: Understanding FOSS Licenses (without a Lawyer)
  speaker: Tom Callaway
  start: 2015-02-21 18:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-21 19:00 PDT
  description: |
    Free and Open Source licenses are a key part of how FOSS works, but
    most of us do not fully understand how (or why) they work. After
    reviewing more than 350 FOSS licenses for Fedora (over the course of
    10 years), Tom has seen almost everything and can share his wisdom
    with you. In this talk, he'll cover the commonly used FOSS licenses,
    describe how they work, and even point out some of the unique
    licenses on the fringe of our universe. Bonus: he's been reading
    Legalese for years (as a non-lawyer who regularly works with
    lawyers at Red Hat), so he can translate licenses back to English.

    He will also cover:

    * The fundamentals of copyrights, trademarks, and patents
    * Public Domain
    * FOSS licenses for non-software works
    * Multiple license scenarios
    * How to choose the right license
    * Why you should never, ever, ever write your own license
    
- title: Gluster Quickstart
  speaker: Thomas Cameron
  start: 2015-02-22 13:30 PDT
  end: 2015-02-22 14:30 PDT
  description: |
    GlusterFS was developed as a distributed filesystem in the oil and gas/high 
    performance compute arena. Using GlusterFS, flexible distributed storage can 
    easily be set up using commodity x86 hardware. Simple, inexpensive internal 
    or JBOD storage can be linked across multiple physical servers and presented 
    as a single storage namespace. This storage can be used for log file, web 
    content, virtual machine, and other storage use cases. Red Hat's Thomas 
    Cameron will demonstrate the steps involved in installing Gluster, configuring 
    disks, linking the Gluster nodes, defining storage bricks, and presenting that 
    storage to clients. He'll talk about tips and tricks, best practices, backup 
    and recovery, and more.

- title: Confessions of a Reluctant Tweeter -- Social Media for Open Source Projects
  speaker: Rikki Endsley
  start: 2015-02-20 15:45 PDT
  end: 2015-02-20 16:45 PDT
  description: |
    Do you cringe when you see #hashtags? Do you roll your eyes at "social media gurus"? 
    Social media should save time (not suck it), but you don't have to be a community 
    manager or have a communications background to leverage the power of 140 characters. 
    With a few quick and easy tips, your open source project can use social media to 
    communicate with contributors, grow its community, and share news and announcements.
    Already love IRC and email lists? Great! This talk will explain how using social media -- 
    such as Twitter, G+, and Facebook -- can complement those good ole reliable communication 
    methods. You also will learn how to determine which social media accounts your project 
    needs, what content to post (and when to post it), who to follow, and how to determine 
    whether your approach is working. Find out how to avoid being the center of an ugly 
    Twitter storm (or pull yourself out when it's too late), and how to keep from being 
    super boring or becoming a spamtastic yawn fest. Using well-known open source projects 
    as examples, this talk will show how one account doubled its followers in three months, 
    and a new open source project had 435 followers the week it launched. This talk 
    provides a crash course in social media to help your project effectively manage its 
    messages and connect with its community.

- title: Community Building the Open Source Way
  speaker: Jason Hibbets
  start: 2015-02-20 17:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-20 18:00 PDT
  description: |
    Over the past five years, Jason Hibbets has been the community manager behind 
    Opensource.com, an online publication focused on highlighting the use of open 
    source methodologies in areas outside of technology. He’ll provide a case study of 
    the content strategy and community building effort for the Opensource.com publication, 
    a project sponsored by Red Hat. You’ll go behind the scenes and see the nuts-and-bolts, 
    the tools, the metrics, and the strategy that’s helped this project grow to over 500,000 
    page views a month. This session will:

    * go in-depth on how to build a great team, including the different methodologies used from the team
    * provide details on social media and SEO strategies
    * outline our community moderator program
    * show metrics and results monitored by the team

- title: How to Thoroughly Insult and Offend People in Your Open Source Communities
  speaker: Gina Likins
  start: 2015-02-20 13:15 PDT
  end: 2015-02-20 14:15 PDT
  description: |
    The tone and tenor of conversations in a community is a large part of whether a 
    community succeeds, yet that’s often a hard concept to model and understand. Using a 
    humorous approach, Gina will demonstrate behaviors that create a hostile community 
    (and by contrast, those that create a welcoming community). She’ll look at the  
    Defcon Insult Scale for Conversations (the DIScon level), from mildly insulting to 
    abusive, and at key signifiers of each level. Audience members will be encouraged to 
    share their own perceptions of how it feels to be at different DIScon levels. Then she'll 
    tackle the more subtle forms of riling folks up (ways you can assume ignorance, belittle 
    people, and/or just be condescending). She's even created a starter list of helpful 
    phrases that people can use as writing prompts when they want to ensure that folks take 
    things the wrong way (phrases like “You may have noticed” and “I’d just like to point out” 
    and “I don’t mean to be [a pedant, sexist, etc], but…”). She'll conclude with steps 
    individuals can take to reduce the “DIScon level” of the communities in which they participate.
  
- title: Linux Charcuterie - How the Distribution Sausage Is Made
  speaker: Ian McLeod
  start: 2015-02-22 15:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-22 16:00 PDT
  description: |
    Distribution build systems are interesting  beasts, complex and with many moving parts. 
    In the past year, containers, Project Atomic, and other changes have forced a rapid  
    evolution in how we consume source and deliver a distribution. This talk will take a look 
    at the entire chain of building a distribution from start to finish. Ian will look at how 
    source is packaged and built, and then how complex combinations of packages are joined 
    together to make a cohesive Linux distribution that successfully installs and runs in a 
    diverse set of environments - from aging x86 hardware to public cloud environments, Linux 
    containers, and immutable systems. He'll talk about the security considerations, collaboration 
    between hundreds (thousands?) of packagers, and working on the engine while the car is running.

- title: Why Scale Up Is Like Star Trek and Scale Out Is Like Star Wars
  speaker: Brian Proffitt
  start: 2015-02-21 15:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-21 16:00 PDT
  description: |
    The difference between the scale up model used in virtual datacenter management tools 
    like oVirt and vSphere and the cloud's scale out model used in OpenStack and CloudStack 
    has historially used the pets versus cattle model. But what if there was another way to 
    describe how virtual machines are handled in the datacenter or the cloud? In this pop-culture talk, 
    Brian Proffitt will expain these concepts and present the idea that it's the starships of Starfleet 
    and the fighters of the Empire and the Alliance that can better demonstrate the complexities 
    of virtual machine management. Datacenter VMs that scale up are more in line with the starships 
    of Starfleet: large, dedicated ships that have an intense amount of investment, not just in 
    the ships themselves, but in the crews that man them. These ships are multifunctional, dedicated 
    to exploration, defense, and intergalactic troubleshooting. Laden with science labs, weaponry, and 
    very diverse crews, these ships are designed to function autonomously in a a variety of situations.
    Compare that with the ships of the Empire or the Alliance. Single-purpose ships with a seemingly 
    lower investment in crews. On the Empire side, there is very little diversity, with ships and 
    weaponry all designed for singular purposes. Empire crews are literally cut from the same cloth, 
    and there is very little autonomy on any scale. The Alliance is slightly better, but their ships 
    seems aligned to counter the Empire model, and so fall into the same "disposable" model. Crew 
    diversity is infinitely better, but the barrier to entry seems a little low ("let's give the kid 
    from the sticks an X-Wing fighter with no formal training!"). In many respects, these fictional 
    universes represent how VMs are treated in the datacenter and the cloud. This talk will take a 
    light-hearted and totally geeked-out approach to discussing VMs in modern IT environments.
    
- title: Makers -- The Next Frontier for Open Source
  speaker: Ruth Suehle
  start: 2015-02-22 10:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-22 11:00 PDT
  description: |
    At a glance, the maker movement seems open source by nature, full of contributors sharing 
    their creations and building from one another. But the reality is quite different. Many 
    (if not most) makers are unfamiliar with open source software even as users, much less with 
    how to implement its principles within their projects. The apparently crossover is indeed a 
    natural fit, thought, and there is much benefit in building communities around tangible projects 
    on open source principles. Of course, there are also different sets of challenges from those 
    faced by software communities. New sets of legal issues arise for open hardware projects. 
    Communities unfamiliar with the evolution of open source projects panic when their goods are 
    cloned. There are also project management and build issues larger than those faced by software 
    projects that only have to handle bits and bytes and not pieces and parts; however, we can see a 
    lot of hope and gain direction from those who have been successful, from groups like the Open 
    Prosthetics Project to the wildly successful Arduino and Raspberry Pi ecosystems. These 
    types of communities set the example for the success of open source in maker communities, 
    and as a result, the success of maker communities' projects for the greater good.

- title: The Key to Open Source Innovation
  speaker: John Mark Walker
  start: 2015-02-20 11:15 PDT
  end: 2015-02-20 12:15 PDT
  description: |
    Open Source is a phenomenon made possible by defined freedoms, managed ecosystems, and the 
    elevation of customers to the same status as developers and vendors, leading to a world where 
    all participants collaborate on open source projects. This innovation was a happy accident: 
    end users were able to collaborate in this way because of the establishment of the four 
    freedoms and the resulting managed ecosystem of open source platforms. The resulting changes 
    in development process led to open source becoming the dominant way to innovate in software. 
    Ultimately, open source is a victory of process, governance and agility, which are at least as 
    important as the code. But what lessons can we take away from open source domination, especially 
    as we push forward in the cloud era? If the four freedoms drove open source development, will 
    they play the same role in the advancement of cloud computing? In this talk, John Mark will look 
    at examples from the cloud computing world and history. Is the secret to innovation the creation 
    of sound processes and good governance?

- title: Storage Tiering and Erasure cCoding in Ceph
  speaker: Sage Weil
  start: 2015-02-22 13:30 PDT
  end: 2015-02-22 14:30 PDT
  description: |
    Ceph is designed around the assumption that all components of the system (disks, hosts, 
    networks) can fail, and has traditionally leveraged replication to provide data durability 
    and reliability. The CRUSH placement algorithm is used to allow failure domains to be defined 
    across hosts, racks, rows, or datacenters, depending on the deployment scale and requirements. 
    Recent releases have added support for erasure coding, which can provide much higher data 
    durability and lower storage overheads. However, in practice erasure codes have different 
    performance characteristics than traditional replication and, under some workloads, come at 
    some expense. At the same time, we have introduced a storage tiering infrastructure and cache 
    pools that allow alternate hardware backends (like high-end flash) to be leveraged for active 
    data sets while cold data are transparently migrated to slower backends. The combination of 
    these two features enables a surprisingly broad range of new applications and deployment configurations.
    This talk will cover a few Ceph fundamentals, discuss the new tiering and erasure coding 
    features, and then discuss a variety of ways that the new capabilities can be leveraged.

    New container-centric tools are changing the way that projects are distributed and 
    scaled in the cloud. Come learn how these open source building blocks can be used to 
    compose complex, multi-container services that offer distinct advantages in scaling and reliability.
    This talk provides an overview of Docker, Kubernetes and Red Hat's new "Atomic" OS distributions, 
    and preview of the next generation OpenShift platform.

- title: Fedora.next -- Bringing Change to a Classic Distro (without too much kicking and screaming)
  speaker: Matthew Miller
  start: 2015-02-22 16:30 PDT
  end: 2015-02-22 17:30 PDT
  description: |
    As the Fedora Project reached its 10th birthday, we starting looking at how computing has 
    changed since we started, and what we need to do to stay relevant, useful, and engaging. 
    The IT world has become much more developer and application-centric, automation is everywhere, 
    and cloud computing brings a whole new scale of operations (along with new privacy and security 
    challenges). Personal computing is giving way to mobile. And Linux and open source are 
    everywhere — in ways we only dreamed of a decade ago. Fedora had an amazing and successful 
    first decade, but as we looked forward, realized that we weren't ideally positioned to 
    meet the challenges this new world brings. Our years of hard work created a polished, 
    capable, and amazing traditional Linux distribution, but our user and contributor communities 
    weren't growing. After much soul-searching on the mailing list and at our contributor conferences,
    we knew we had to make some changes. We also knew that we wanted to stay true to our core values — 
    freedom, friends, features, and first — and we didn't want to turn back on the things we've gotten 
    right. So, we worked on several initiatives under the umbrella term "Fedora.next". This includes 
    the separate Fedora Cloud, Fedora Workstation, and Fedora Server flavors, constructed to fit 
    specific user bases and use cases in a way we've never done before. And it includes a more 
    ambitious plan to decompose the thousands of packages in the Fedora repository into modular 
    components in a "ring" structure. It also comes with a new governance model — the consensus-based 
    and objective-oriented Fedora Council. Matthew Miller, the Fedora Project Leader, will talk about 
    all of these things and about where we might be going next, and will answer your questions about 
    anything and everything Fedora related.

- title: Linux Desktop -- When Is Our Year?
  speaker: Levente Kurusa
  start: 2015-02-21 18:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-21 19:00 PDT
  description: |
    Levente's talk will start with some information about the current Desktop market, 
    the status of the Linux Desktop and its different environments. He will discuss some problems he found
    and how they are related to each other. These problems vary in nature from community and diversity problems to 
    the problem of the enterprise overriding the needs of the desktop. The community must work together 
    to solve these problems so that people who aren't tech-savvy can use a Linux distribution and enjoy it.
