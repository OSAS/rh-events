- title: Provision and manage Docker containers with Foreman
  speaker: Daniel Lobato Garcia
  start: 2015-02-06 - 13:20
  end: 2015-02-06 - 14:00
  room: D100
  track: Containers
  description: |
    Deploying containers, images with Docker is becoming a big trend.
    However, large installations of containerized applications are still
    few and far between, and solutions are either proprietary or they
    force you to use their own cloud.
    We believe Foreman can fill this space by providing a central space
    to provision and manage your containers and your network, as we already
    do with your data center. This provides a great framework for mixed
    environments where physical machines, vms, and containers are all used
    in conjunction. Orchestration through Kubernetes is being implemented
    at the moment.
    Monitoring, deploying, and everything else is possible to do through
    the web UI or an API, and it's open source, so if you miss any feature,
    feel free to add it!
