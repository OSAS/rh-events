- title: 'Moving your virtual machines to oVirt with ease: overview of the process
    of import VMs from different environments into oVirt in light of the upcoming
    integration with virt-v2v'
  speaker: Arik Hadas

  description: |
    Suppose you want to import virtual machines you already have into oVirt
    to enjoy a features-rich open sourced management system. You will soon
    figure out that the conversion of virtual machines running on different
    hypervisors or managed by different management systems into oVirt is not
    an easy task. The next major version of oVirt is going to introduce an
    integrated process that will simplify import of virtual machines not
    being managed by oVirt into oVirt. This session gives a heads up for the
    feature: we will go over the design and see how it solves issues that we
    had before to provide better way for import virtual machines to oVirt.

    The oVirt project allows efficient management of virtualized
    datacenters. Deciding what machine should host a certain VM is one of
    the important functions of the management platform. Unfortunately it is
    also one of the complex ones, because there can be many rules governing
    the placement policy and there is a time limit in which a VM has to be
    started or migration initiated. Till now each VM was considered
    separately and that caused fragmentation of free resources.

    We are about to present a new solution to this issue in this
    presentation. We have started a cooperation with the OptaPlanner team
    that develops an optimization engine based on probabilistic (soft
    computing) algorithms. This means that oVirt will feed situation updates
    to an optimization service and continuously receive improved solutions
    back. It will then use the precomputed results for rebalancing the
    clusters.

    We've been talking about Infrastructure providers for quite a bit
    already. OpenStack itself started as such an IaaS and then it quickly
    became a cloud provider. But what does that mean? What is a cloud
    provider suppose to provide? What's cloud after all?

    Scaling a distributed system goes beyond virtualization, shared storage
    etc. In order to support on-demand scaling it is necessary to have an
    easy way to provision and consume the available infrastructure, a way
    for the services running in it to communicate, etc. Not to mention
    latency needs, reliability, etc.

    This talk aims to answer the above questions and take a step further
    down the path of explaining what should be considered essential for
    nowadays needs, especially when those needs require a `cloud` to be
    covered.

    The Foreman project and its community is varied, big, and it can take
    very long to understand what is really going on. Luckily, a group of
    people is actually working full-time on making it a better project.
    Contributors often scratch their own itches, and move on.

    This talk is meant to give you an overview about areas of Foreman that
    badly need help, refactoring, and some of the efforts the Foreman
    community is doing to mitigate technical debt and keep on improving. In
    short, we want to highlight our flaws so you can target your efforts to

- title: 'Valgrind integration in the Eclipse IDE: an overview of the Valgrind plugin'
  speaker: Lukas Berk
  start: 2015-01-31 10:30 CET
  end: 2015-01-31 11:20 CET
  room: AW1.120
  track: Valgrind
  description: |
    Software development rarely has "spare" time, which often forces
    developers to stick to the tools they already know. Having any sort of
    learning curve can be a barrier to entry for debugging and performance
    tools, even when the payoffs are worth the time invested learning new
    tools. The Linux Tools Project aims to improve the state of C/C++
    development on the Eclipse IDE by integrating popular tools, such as
    Valgrind. This integration allows developers to maintain an environment
    they're familiar with, yet leverage new development tools.

    This talk is aimed at people of varying experience with the Valgrind
    tool who have never used it within the Eclipse IDE.

  track: Network management and SDN
  description: |
    Imagine buying off the shelf switch hardware, install Fedora (or any
    other distribution) and configure it using standard linux tools. This is
    not possible at the moment primarily because of lack of unified and
    consistent platforms and driver interfaces. We are working to change
    that.

    The current state of support for switch chips in Linux is not good. Each
    vendor provides userspace binary sdk blob that only works with their
    chips. Each of this blobs has proprietary APIs. To get switch chips
    properly supported there's need to introduce a new infrastructure
    directly into Linux kernel and to work with vendors to adopt it.

    This talk presents the current effort to unify and uphold the Linux
    networking model across the spectrum of devices which is necessary to
    make Linux the cornerstone of industrial grade networking. The scope of
    this talk covers state of art with current implementation of standard
    commodity switches such as top of rack switches, small home gateway
    device as well as SR-IOV NIC embedded switches.

    A device model and driver infrastructure will be presented for
    accelerating the Linux bridge, Linux router, accelerated host virtual
    switches and flow level offloads when supported by the hardware
    underneath.

    Debugging performance problems can be a daunting task, especially when
    you are short on time and lack proper tools that integrate nicely with
    your custom application landscape. Thermostat was designed to answer the
    most interesting questions related to performance measurement and
    application monitoring. It takes advantage of performance metrics and
    serviceability features of OpenJDK to provide a holistic view of the
    system. In this session, attendees will get a chance to see Thermostat
    in action as it is used to analyse programs, gather data, and debug
    issues affecting performance and functionality.

  description: |
    Caciocavallo has been one of the very first external projects to land in
    the OpenJDK repository and sponsored by the OpenJDK Porters Group. Named
    after a delicious cheese we're never tired of eating, it had the
    original purpose of refactoring the AWT peers to allow different
    implementations to be added to OpenJDK. The project evolved very quickly
    until it became itself a full implementation of AWT based on Swing with
    just enough abstraction to allow custom plugging into the Java2D system
    for rendering. As time passed, this characteristic was used to implement
    a GUI testing framework running on offscreen buffers to avoid the usual
    problems of focus stealing and random mouse moving that plague every
    other GUI testing framework (here everything is emulated!), and finally
    a full Web based backend to allow application to run remotely but still
    be visible on the local screen. This talk will cover the progress we
    have done over the years, we will show how easy is to implement a new
    backend and how this project could be used to give Wayland support to
    OpenJDK. We will show the testing framework and finally we will discuss
    about WebJDK, an idea to give more web oriented functionality to OpenJDK
    and use the web backend to enable fully cloud based applications.

    What really happens to your Java code along the way to becoming machine
    code?

    Red Hat has been developing an almost pauseless GC for OpenJDK which
    requires adding read barriers to every object access. We've also
    developed ARM64 versions of both the server and the client compilers.
    This has given us quite a bit of experience with the internals of the
    various methods of generating machine code inside the JVM. This talk
    will start with a brief tour of the various levels of code generation
    available and then open up the floor for questions from our panel.

    JRuby 9000 represents the biggest-ever leap forward for JRuby. Not only
    have we caught up on compatibility (9000 will be 2.2-compatible from
    release), but we've completely redesigned our JVM-based runtime and have
    opened our codebase up to the JRuby+Truffle research project from Oracle
    Labs. The changes we've made will make it easier to keep up with MRI on
    compatibility and give us the potential to run Ruby as fast as Java or
    C. The entire Ruby world will change over the next year, and JRuby 9000
    will be leading the way. We'll talk about what Ruby's going to look like
    once JRuby is "over 9000".

    Deploying containers, images with Docker is becoming a big trend.
    However, large installations of containerized applications are still few
    and far between, and solutions are either proprietary or they force you
    to use their own cloud.

    We believe Foreman can fill this space by providing a central space to
    provision and manage your containers and your network, as we already do
    with your data center. This provides a great framework for mixed
    environments where physical machines, vms, and containers are all used
    in conjunction. Orchestration through Kubernetes is being implemented at
    the moment.

    Monitoring, deploying, and everything else is possible to do through the
    web UI or an API, and it's open source, so if you miss any feature, feel
    free to add it!

    This talk will describe the state of OpenStack packaging on Fedora &
    CentOS through the project RDO.

    Openstack is a big player in the FOSS IaaS field, yet, it's still a
    challenge to package it and integrate it into major GNU/Linux Distros.
    Here, we'll see how it is packaged and maintained in Fedora/CentOS and
    what are the plans in the near future.

    CentOS Project exists now for more than 10 years now, and some people
    are wondering how the CentOS.org Infra is managed. We'll explain all the
    tools we use to maintain that infra, but also the constraints we have
    due to the fact that our infra is spread around the world on
    community/donated machines, without SLA and disappearing without
    notification. We'd like to also not only present how we run the infra,
    from a community perspective, but a real discussion with other
    distributions (round-table discussion ? ) about those common issues, and
    how to solve those

    GlusterFS is a scale out storage solution which has wide range of uses
    cases.

    GlusterFS is one of the founding members of Storage SIG. We have been
    able to successfully bootstrap GlusterFS in the Storage SIG. Relevant
    RPMs have been build for the SIG using the new CentOS build system.
    During the last couple of months of bootstrapping GlusterFS in the
    storage SIG we have faced some technical challenges which will be
    applicable to other SIGs (current and Future). During this talk we will
    share our experiences and discuss the technical challenges GlusterFS
    faced, how we solved it and the thought process around it. In this talk
    we will also talk about how Storage SIG is trying to give best upstream
    experience to community/users.

    server'

    For the development of openconnect VPN server a decision to
    compartmentalize the server was taken, in order to protect any sensitive
    values exchanged, ranging from the user transferred data, to the data
    used during the authentication process. This talk will summarize the
    issues faced during that development that relate to software isolation.
    That would cover issues with protecting the server's keys via TLS, the
    client-side authentication of TLS, and PAM authentication, and how they
    were solved.

    CPU specific issues'

    OpenJDK comes with a zero assembler port called Zero. Back in 2009 when
    Zero was originally developed by Gary Benson, OpenJDK was available only
    on x86, x86\_64 and SPARK. Despite recent JIT ports, such as the AArch64
    and ppc/aix port, Zero still remains relevant for many Linux
    distributions. For example, at Red Hat we build and use the OpenJDK zero
    variant on PPC/PPC64 and s390/s390x. What's more it's a useful tool for
    getting new JIT ports built from source using free software.

    This talk will give a brief summary what Zero is and how it works. It
    will cover some of the recently discovered issues with sustaining the
    Zero port, how we try to catch them early and it will explain our
    experience with pushing fixes upstream. There will also be examples how
    this effort benefits the OpenJDK ecosystem as a whole.

    We've been working on OpenJDK for a long time now and we've gained a lot
    of experience working on the code itself and, perhaps more importantly,
    working with the Java team inside Oracle. This talk is about our
    experiences trying make one of the largest ever external contributions
    to OpenJDK, the AArch64 port.

    I'll talk about how the OpenJDK contribution process works, and how it
    doesn't work, and how important it is to gain the trust of people inside
    Oracle's Java team. I'll discuss the strange asymmetry of being an
    external contributor to a project but not being able to know all of what
    is going on. I'll try my best to explain the baffling role of Projects
    and JEPs. I'll speculate about the future of OpenJDK and how it must
    change as more people outside Oracle contribute significant slabs of
    code, and how we must have more external patch reviewers.

    Finally, I'll open up the floor for discussion. I'm sure we'll have a
    lot to talk about.

    As one of the earliest adopters of Method Handles, I've had to build
    many of my own tools. InvokeBinder is one of them, providing a literal
    (or fluent) API for Method Handles that allows site-forward adaptation,
    name-based argument list manipulation, and many bonuses usually too
    complicated to write by hand. I'd like to demonstrate its features and
    enlist others to help me improve it.

    Garbage Collection pauses make it hard for Java applications to meet
    quality of service guarantees. No matter how fast your application
    processes requests, a 30 second GC pause is going to ruin any guarantees
    you might want to make.

    Shenandoah is a new GC algorithm designed to address this issue. We take
    a simple approach that allows us to do more work while your Java program
    is running so we can substantially reduce the time the JVM is paused.
    Our goal is to be able to garbage collect 100gb+ heaps in under 10ms.

    This talk will focus on the current status of the project, the goals
    we've met so far, and what we are hoping to achieve in the coming year.
    We might even share some performance numbers.

    There's a ton of stuff going on in OpenJDK, projects, repositories, bug
    database, experiments. This is a lot of potential fun, but the entrance
    barrier for newcomers is extremely high, and it's easy to get lost and
    not enjoy the fun anymore. In order to help people wanting to contribute
    keep track of this intricate forest of development and find their way
    out, the Adoption Group was created
    (http://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/).

    This session is an exchange between few of the hackers directly involved
    with the Adoption Group and the public. We will indeed discuss some of
    the projects we are currently involved with - like the planned global
    hack days for jsonp, jigsaw and tools that use jigsaw and http 2.0 with
    language interoperability - but above all we will answer questions the
    audience may have in relation to getting involved with OpenJDK, both
    from a technical perspective and a social one, so that next year you can
    sit together with us helping even more people to jump on the fun!

    If you need help organising your next hackday, or you are completelylost
    tying to get started with OpenJDK, this is the session for you!
