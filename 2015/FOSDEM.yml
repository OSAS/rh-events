- title: 'Moving your virtual machines to oVirt with ease: overview of the process
    of import VMs from different environments into oVirt in light of the upcoming
    integration with virt-v2v'
  speaker: Arik Hadas

  track: Infrastructure as a service
  description: |
    Suppose you want to import virtual machines you already have into oVirt
    to enjoy a features-rich open sourced management system. You will soon
    figure out that the conversion of virtual machines running on different
    hypervisors or managed by different management systems into oVirt is not
    an easy task. The next major version of oVirt is going to introduce an
    integrated process that will simplify import of virtual machines not
    being managed by oVirt into oVirt. This session gives a heads up for the
    feature: we will go over the design and see how it solves issues that we
    had before to provide better way for import virtual machines to oVirt.

  room: UD2.120 (Chavanne)
  track: Virtualisation
  description: |
    The oVirt project allows efficient management of virtualized
    datacenters. Deciding what machine should host a certain VM is one of
    the important functions of the management platform. Unfortunately it is
    also one of the complex ones, because there can be many rules governing
    the placement policy and there is a time limit in which a VM has to be
    started or migration initiated. Till now each VM was considered
    separately and that caused fragmentation of free resources.

    We are about to present a new solution to this issue in this
    presentation. We have started a cooperation with the OptaPlanner team
    that develops an optimization engine based on probabilistic (soft
    computing) algorithms. This means that oVirt will feed situation updates
    to an optimization service and continuously receive improved solutions
    back. It will then use the precomputed results for rebalancing the
    clusters.

- title: 'What you can do with open source cloud management (and ManageIQ): control
    all of the things'

    Now in its fourth year, the FOSDEM Legal and Policy Issues DevRoom
    covers topics of licensing, legal, governance issues, and more as it
    relates to Open Source and Free Software projects.

    Attendees are welcome to come and engage in lively debate with our
    excellent speakers. Please come with your questions, comments or
    concerns. The DevRoom talks are carefully chosen to avoid merely being
    introductory: we believe that FOSDEM attendees are well informed on
    these issues, and we welcome participation for all. Our goal in
    organizing this DevRoom is to bring the previously secretive and
    non-public discussion on these sorts of issues to a public forum.

  track: Legal and policy issues
  description: |
    Recent revelations about the scope of government surveillance have
    touched off renewed interest in encryption and personal data privacy,
    and prompted technology companies to offer more protections for users'
    data. In response, the U.S. government has made moves toward increased
    regulation of encryption software. This talk will discuss the laws
    regulating surveillance and cryptography, how those laws apply to free
    software, and opportunities for community response to the new crypto
    wars.

- title: Towards legal criteria for best practices in Free Software/open source development
  speaker: Richard Fontana
  start: 2015-01-31 17:00 CET
  end: 2015-01-31 17:25 CET
  room: H.1308 (Rolin)
  track: Legal and policy issues
  description: |
    This talk will propose several ideas for inclusion in a set of modern
    legal standards for good practices in FLOSS development and governance
    beyond the traditional emphasis on software freedom-conformant source
    code licensing. The theme will be maximizing diverse, egalitarian and
    authentically meritocratic participation, minimizing legal impediments,
    and avoiding distortion or corruption by powerful project stakeholders.
    Ideas to be discussed include distributed and symmetrical copyright
    licensing, fair trademark policies, appropriate approaches to patent
    nonassertion by corporate participants, and commitments by projects or
    associated foundations to promoting diverse and safe environments for
    development work.

    Ideas discussed in this talk may form the basis for work done by the
    Open Source Initiative during the coming year.

- title: 'Valgrind integration in the Eclipse IDE: an overview of the Valgrind plugin'
  speaker: Lukas Berk
  start: 2015-01-31 10:30 CET
  end: 2015-01-31 11:20 CET
  room: AW1.120
  track: Valgrind
  description: |
    Software development rarely has "spare" time, which often forces
    developers to stick to the tools they already know. Having any sort of
    learning curve can be a barrier to entry for debugging and performance
    tools, even when the payoffs are worth the time invested learning new
    tools. The Linux Tools Project aims to improve the state of C/C++
    development on the Eclipse IDE by integrating popular tools, such as
    Valgrind. This integration allows developers to maintain an environment
    they're familiar with, yet leverage new development tools.

    This talk is aimed at people of varying experience with the Valgrind
    tool who have never used it within the Eclipse IDE.

- title: 'How to start hacking on Valgrind by example: easy hacks for Valgrind'
  speaker: Mark Wielaard

    If you always wanted to hack on Valgrind, but haven't yet really looked
    at the code yet, this talk is for you. We'll got over the basics of
    writing a new Valgrind tool. How to add a missing syscall. Show where to
    start when adding a new x86/amd64 instruction and translating it to VEX
    IR. After attending this talk, you should be all set to attend the
    hackaton in the Valgrind devroom at the end of the day.

    Open vSwitch has traditionally focused on stateless L2-L4 packet
    processing. The introduction of stateful connection tracking, NAT, and
    L7 service integration extend the scope of Open vSwitch usage. In this
    talk, we will discuss the introduction of stateful services and cover
    the implementation of reflexive ACL and integration of L7 DPI on the
    data center edge.

- title: Hardware switches - the opensource approach
  speaker: Jiří Pírko

  track: Network management and SDN
  description: |
    Imagine buying off the shelf switch hardware, install Fedora (or any
    other distribution) and configure it using standard linux tools. This is
    not possible at the moment primarily because of lack of unified and
    consistent platforms and driver interfaces. We are working to change
    that.

    The current state of support for switch chips in Linux is not good. Each
    vendor provides userspace binary sdk blob that only works with their
    chips. Each of this blobs has proprietary APIs. To get switch chips
    properly supported there's need to introduce a new infrastructure
    directly into Linux kernel and to work with vendors to adopt it.

    This talk presents the current effort to unify and uphold the Linux
    networking model across the spectrum of devices which is necessary to
    make Linux the cornerstone of industrial grade networking. The scope of
    this talk covers state of art with current implementation of standard
    commodity switches such as top of rack switches, small home gateway
    device as well as SR-IOV NIC embedded switches.

    A device model and driver infrastructure will be presented for
    accelerating the Linux bridge, Linux router, accelerated host virtual
    switches and flow level offloads when supported by the hardware
    underneath.

  description: |
    Debugging performance problems can be a daunting task, especially when
    you are short on time and lack proper tools that integrate nicely with
    your custom application landscape. Thermostat was designed to answer the
    most interesting questions related to performance measurement and
    application monitoring. It takes advantage of performance metrics and
    serviceability features of OpenJDK to provide a holistic view of the
    system. In this session, attendees will get a chance to see Thermostat
    in action as it is used to analyse programs, gather data, and debug
    issues affecting performance and functionality.

- title: Caciocavallo, or how we ported OpenJDK from embedded to cloud and still liked
    it

  room: K.4.201
  track: Java
  description: |
    Caciocavallo has been one of the very first external projects to land in
    the OpenJDK repository and sponsored by the OpenJDK Porters Group. Named
    after a delicious cheese we're never tired of eating, it had the
    original purpose of refactoring the AWT peers to allow different
    implementations to be added to OpenJDK. The project evolved very quickly
    until it became itself a full implementation of AWT based on Swing with
    just enough abstraction to allow custom plugging into the Java2D system
    for rendering. As time passed, this characteristic was used to implement
    a GUI testing framework running on offscreen buffers to avoid the usual
    problems of focus stealing and random mouse moving that plague every
    other GUI testing framework (here everything is emulated!), and finally
    a full Web based backend to allow application to run remotely but still
    be visible on the local screen. This talk will cover the progress we
    have done over the years, we will show how easy is to implement a new
    backend and how this project could be used to give Wayland support to
    OpenJDK. We will show the testing framework and finally we will discuss
    about WebJDK, an idea to give more web oriented functionality to OpenJDK
    and use the web backend to enable fully cloud based applications.

    What really happens to your Java code along the way to becoming machine
    code?

    Red Hat has been developing an almost pauseless GC for OpenJDK which
    requires adding read barriers to every object access. We've also
    developed ARM64 versions of both the server and the client compilers.
    This has given us quite a bit of experience with the internals of the
    various methods of generating machine code inside the JVM. This talk
    will start with a brief tour of the various levels of code generation
    available and then open up the floor for questions from our panel.

    This year the JFree project (that’s JFreeChart and friends) turns 15!
    Though looking forward not backward is the JFree way, so this session
    will cover a couple of the latest free things we’ve been working on. We
    fly _high_ above the low level virtual machine technology, even above
    the standard Java APIs, so if you want to soar with eagles (and your
    brain hurts from some other talks about complex low-level _magic_) then
    come a see some shiny graphical things and we’ll promise not to talk
    about anything that’s complicated!

    In this session, you will hear about our recent JavaFX work, or get a
    quick demo of JFreeSVG, or maybe we’ll surprise you with something else
    graphical, awesome and free. :-)

    have we caught up on compatibility (9000 will be 2.2-compatible from
    release), but we've completely redesigned our JVM-based runtime and have
    opened our codebase up to the JRuby+Truffle research project from Oracle
    Labs. The changes we've made will make it easier to keep up with MRI on
    compatibility and give us the potential to run Ruby as fast as Java or
    C. The entire Ruby world will change over the next year, and JRuby 9000
    will be leading the way. We'll talk about what Ruby's going to look like
    once JRuby is "over 9000".

    Deploying containers, images with Docker is becoming a big trend.
    However, large installations of containerized applications are still few
    and far between, and solutions are either proprietary or they force you
    to use their own cloud.

    We believe Foreman can fill this space by providing a central space to
    provision and manage your containers and your network, as we already do
    with your data center. This provides a great framework for mixed
    environments where physical machines, vms, and containers are all used
    in conjunction. Orchestration through Kubernetes is being implemented at
    the moment.

    Monitoring, deploying, and everything else is possible to do through the
    web UI or an API, and it's open source, so if you miss any feature, feel
    free to add it!

    often used with libvirt in non-cloud scenarios. With multiple layers of
    software between the user and the virtual machine, how does one
    troubleshoot failures and performance issues?

    This presentation covers tools and techniques for observing virtual
    machines with the KVM hypervisor. It gives you a mental model of KVM's
    architecture so you'll know how to get to the bottom of questions about
    virtual machine behavior and performance.

    Areas covered include guest CPU activity, RAM, disk I/O, network
    traffic, and the QEMU monitor. Examples are based on real-life scenarios
    often encountered by KVM users.

    OpenJDK comes with a zero assembler port called Zero. Back in 2009 when
    Zero was originally developed by Gary Benson, OpenJDK was available only
    on x86, x86\_64 and SPARK. Despite recent JIT ports, such as the AArch64
    and ppc/aix port, Zero still remains relevant for many Linux
    distributions. For example, at Red Hat we build and use the OpenJDK zero
    variant on PPC/PPC64 and s390/s390x. What's more it's a useful tool for
    getting new JIT ports built from source using free software.

    This talk will give a brief summary what Zero is and how it works. It
    will cover some of the recently discovered issues with sustaining the
    Zero port, how we try to catch them early and it will explain our
    experience with pushing fixes upstream. There will also be examples how
    this effort benefits the OpenJDK ecosystem as a whole.

    We've been working on OpenJDK for a long time now and we've gained a lot
    of experience working on the code itself and, perhaps more importantly,
    working with the Java team inside Oracle. This talk is about our
    experiences trying make one of the largest ever external contributions
    to OpenJDK, the AArch64 port.

    I'll talk about how the OpenJDK contribution process works, and how it
    doesn't work, and how important it is to gain the trust of people inside
    Oracle's Java team. I'll discuss the strange asymmetry of being an
    external contributor to a project but not being able to know all of what
    is going on. I'll try my best to explain the baffling role of Projects
    and JEPs. I'll speculate about the future of OpenJDK and how it must
    change as more people outside Oracle contribute significant slabs of
    code, and how we must have more external patch reviewers.

    Finally, I'll open up the floor for discussion. I'm sure we'll have a
    lot to talk about.

    As one of the earliest adopters of Method Handles, I've had to build
    many of my own tools. InvokeBinder is one of them, providing a literal
    (or fluent) API for Method Handles that allows site-forward adaptation,
    name-based argument list manipulation, and many bonuses usually too
    complicated to write by hand. I'd like to demonstrate its features and
    enlist others to help me improve it.

    Garbage Collection pauses make it hard for Java applications to meet
    quality of service guarantees. No matter how fast your application
    processes requests, a 30 second GC pause is going to ruin any guarantees
    you might want to make.

    Shenandoah is a new GC algorithm designed to address this issue. We take
    a simple approach that allows us to do more work while your Java program
    is running so we can substantially reduce the time the JVM is paused.
    Our goal is to be able to garbage collect 100gb+ heaps in under 10ms.

    This talk will focus on the current status of the project, the goals
    we've met so far, and what we are hoping to achieve in the coming year.
    We might even share some performance numbers.

    There's a ton of stuff going on in OpenJDK, projects, repositories, bug
    database, experiments. This is a lot of potential fun, but the entrance
    barrier for newcomers is extremely high, and it's easy to get lost and
    not enjoy the fun anymore. In order to help people wanting to contribute
    keep track of this intricate forest of development and find their way
    out, the Adoption Group was created
    (http://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/).

    This session is an exchange between few of the hackers directly involved
    with the Adoption Group and the public. We will indeed discuss some of
    the projects we are currently involved with - like the planned global
    hack days for jsonp, jigsaw and tools that use jigsaw and http 2.0 with
    language interoperability - but above all we will answer questions the
    audience may have in relation to getting involved with OpenJDK, both
    from a technical perspective and a social one, so that next year you can
    sit together with us helping even more people to jump on the fun!

    If you need help organising your next hackday, or you are completelylost
    tying to get started with OpenJDK, this is the session for you!

    This presentation will discuss the plans to move Xorg to use libinput
    too through an input driver called xf86-input-libinput, as well as the
    status of this move. xf86-input-libinput is scheduled to be the default
    Xorg input driver for Fedora 22.
