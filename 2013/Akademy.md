## Shining Bright, Flaming Out: The Ambitious FOSS Contributor’s Guide to Burnout
### Name: Leslie Hawthorn with Lydia Pintscher, KDE & The Wikimedia Foundation
### Time: July 13, 2013, 15:15 - 15:45 CET

Contributors to free and open source software projects are no strangers to burnout. Whether its feeling burned out ourselves or watching others who have once contributed prolifically to a project fall by the way, its clear that many come to free software for our passions, but can be overwhelmed by its pressures. Failing to address causes of - and cases of - burnout is a great way to increase your project’s bus factor.

In this talk, Leslie and Lydia will explore common causes of contributor burnout and how both projects and individuals can avoid these pitfalls. They will also explore how to best handle cases of in-progress burnout - a.k.a. the long slow burn - and tips for mitigating it. Last but not least, they’ll talk about how to reclaim your mojo after suffering burnout, helping attendees reignite their passions whilst not flaming out.


# Negotiation Theory for Geeks: Getting What You Want with a Minimum of Misery
### Name: Leslie Hawthorn with Lydia Pintscher, KDE & The Wikimedia Foundation

While it would be great if we could always just all “get along,” we’re all human and we disagree frequently - even with our closest friends and collaborators. While the free software world is full of useful processes and rules to share code, we have no “manual” to teach us how to effectively share our feelings, thoughts and personal preferences. Top that all off with the fact that these less rational areas of our psyches are the wellsprings for our productivity and creativity, and the chances for having an unfun day look a lot higher.

Fear not! In this talk, Leslie and Lydia will explore a variety of techniques for conflict resolution in your free software project. Drawing on a variety of resources including the Harvard Negotiation Project, they will explore strategies for effectively communicating yoru needs, reaching agreement and how to strengthen relationships during contentious discussions. While these lessons will not immediately create a field of sunshine and unicorns in your FOSS project, they will provide a useful framework for agreeing to disagree.
