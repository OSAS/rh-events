## Managing Your Metal Flexibly

The Foreman is adding a Metal-as-a-Service feature in the near future. In this lightning talk, we'll show the current status of the work, and discuss where it's heading to eventually.

The systemd project is now two years old (almost three). It found adoption as

## Introducing GNOME Photos
### Name: Debarshi Ray
### Room: CrossDesktop DevRoom

Photos is an application to access, organize and share your photos with 
GNOME 3. After Documents it is the latest among the new breed of Finding &
Reminding applications. Like other core GNOME applications, it targets a new
GNOME 3 style: cloud integration, fresh UI elements and touch enablement.

This talk will outline the use cases and principles, how it relates to existing
third party applications, and the use of Tracker as a meta-data store.

### Name: Oved Ourfali
### Room: Virtualization Devroom

In this presentation I'll describe some standard and common cloud
APIs such as EC2 and CIMI, and show how one can use Deltacloud in
order to support them on top ofcloud environments. As an example, I'll
show how to add this support and use it on top of the oVirt engine.


## Using Foreman from the oVirt-engine Administrator UI
### Name: Oved Ourfali
### Room: Virtualization Devroom

In this presentation I'll show how one can use the new oVirt-Engine UI-Plugin infrastructure,
to add a Foreman-UI-plugin, that allows querying Foreman information on oVirt entities, and preform different
Foreman-related operations on them.
