## How to build an Identity Management System on Linux
### Name: Simo Sorce
### Room: Janson
### Time: February 2, 2013 17:00 - 12:50 CET

How do you build a comprehensive and coherent Identity Management System
on Linux? This is the question I started answering 7 years ago when I
joined Red Hat, and is still being worked on today. In this talk I will
present a broad overview of all the aspects of Identity Management that
need to be considered to have a full end-to-end solution, for the server
components (Kerberos, LDAP, DNS, Management components, etc..) that are
managed under the umbrella of the FreeIPA project to the client
components (SSSD and utilities) and all the other hidden parts (like
GSS-Proxy, Samba libraries) that are normally not easily visible but
that become needed once you get down to playing with the bits. The talk
will go down into the technical details and the whys and hows of the
whole architecture.


## Managing Your Metal Flexibly
### Name: Greg Sutcliffe
### Time: February 3, 2013, 11:00 CET

The Foreman is adding a Metal-as-a-Service feature in the near future. In this lightning talk, we'll show the current status of the work, and discuss where it's heading to eventually.


## systemd, Two Years Later
### Name: Lennart Poettering
### Room: Janson
### Time: February 3, 2013 12:00 - 12:50 CET

The systemd project is now two years old (almost three). It found adoption as 
the core of many big community and commercial Linux distributions. It's time 
to look back what we achieved, what we didn't achieve, how we dealt with the 
various controversies, and what's to come next.


## Introducing GNOME Photos
### Name: Debarshi Ray
### Room: CrossDesktop DevRoom
### Time: February 3, 2013 16:40 - 17:00 CET

Photos is an application to access, organize and share your photos with 
GNOME 3. After Documents it is the latest among the new breed of Finding &
Reminding applications. Like other core GNOME applications, it targets a new
GNOME 3 style: cloud integration, fresh UI elements and touch enablement.

This talk will outline the use cases and principles, how it relates to existing
third party applications, and the use of Tracker as a meta-data store.

## (R)evolution of Java Packaging in GNU/Linux
### Name: Mikołaj Izdebski and Stanislav Ochotnický
### Room: Free Java DevRoom
### Time: February 2, 2013 12:30 - 13:00 CET

Java packaging in Linux has never been trivial. Partially due to strict
principles that most Linux distributions adhere to, partially due to Java
ecosystem encouraging behavior which goes against these principles, but mostly
due to ineffective tooling on both sides of the fence.

Over past 2 years, tooling and guidelines for packaging Java have changed in
Fedora Linux considerably. What used to be a 1000 line build script can soon
become 100 lines of mostly metadata. But all of that relies on sane build system
with predictable behavior on Java side: Maven.

During the course of the talk we will clean up one such build script and describe
how each change was made possible. Most importantly we hope to convince the
audience that for common good, using Maven for Java development even with all
its quirks is better than the alternatives. A wider discussion on Java
build systems would also be welcome.
