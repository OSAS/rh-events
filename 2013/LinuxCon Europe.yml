- title: RAM Snapshots in oVirt
  speaker: Arik Hadas
  start: 2013-10-21 12:00 IST
  end: 2013-10-21 12:00 IST
  description: |
    The oVirt Project is an open virtualization project providing a
    feature-rich server and desktop virtualization management platform,
    based on the powerful Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.
    Live Snapshots is considered to be one of the most powerful features in
    oVirt, making it possible to take a snapshot for a VM while the VM is
    running. oVirt 3.3 introduces a major enhancement to oVirt Live
    Snapshots: now they can contain the state of the memory of the VM in
    addition to the state of its disks. The presentation includes
    interesting technical aspects of the feature, and explain how it can be
    used: \* Brief overview of oVirt architecture \* Overview of oVirt
    Snapshots & Live Snapshots \* Deep dive into the technical process of
    creating and restoring Live Snapshots with Memory \* Guidance how to
    make simple and advanced snapshots related operations via UI & REST API

- title: oVirt and Cloud-init Integration
  speaker: Omer Frenkel
  start: 2013-10-21 13:00 IST
  end: 2013-10-21 13:00 IST
  description: |
    The oVirt Project is an open virtualization project providing a
    feature-rich server and desktop virtualization management platform, and
    Cloud-Init is multi-distribution package that handles early
    initialization of a cloud instance. Recently those were integrated
    together to allow users and administrators easily apply automated
    configuration and initialization on vms using oVirt. In this session,
    Omer will give short introduction to these projects and describe the
    work that has been done integrating them, including some technical
    explanation. In addition, Omer will describe how to use Cloud-Init with
    oVirt and will give use-case examples, and discuss what else need to be
    done.

- title: Architectural Changes in NetworkManager
  speaker: Pavel Šimerda
  start: 2013-10-21 13:00 IST
  end: 2013-10-21 13:00 IST
  description: |
    People have benefited from using NetworkManager on laptops and other
    user-facing systems for years, long before I joined the project. But the
    last year of development primarily focused on server and virtualization
    use cases, whose requirements are entirely different. Pavel Šimerda will
    speak about the vast architectural changes NetworkManager is undergoing
    to support all of the currently considered use cases. We will also talk
    about the actual features that can (and often will) be backed by the
    architecture. While some of them require modification of NetworkManager
    code, many can be done with the scripting capabilities or NetworkManager
    API/CLI. Interoperability with specific other software like unbound and
    dnssec-trigger will be discussed as well.

- title: Empowering Data Center Virtualization Using KVM
  speaker: Livnat Peer
  start: 2013-10-21 15:20 IST
  end: 2013-10-21 15:20 IST
  description: |
    Have you ever wondered how KVM is used in a full blown Data Center
    virtualization solution? oVirt is an open virtualization project which
    enables the management of multi-host, multi-tenant virtual data centers,
    including high availability, VM and storage live migration, storage and
    network management, system scheduler and more. oVirt provides an
    integration point for several open source virtualization technologies,
    including kvm, libvirt, spice, oVirt node and numerous OpenStack
    components such as Neutron and Glance. The session will provide an
    introduction to the oVirt project and shed light on how a data center
    administrator's actions in a web UI are translated into KVM commands
    running on the hypervisors.

- title: Converged Infrastructure with Open Source
  speaker: Theron Conrey
  start: 2013-10-21 17:40 IST
  end: 2013-10-21 17:40 IST
  description: |
    Converged infrastructure is an idea for virtualization infrastructure
    that is enabling organizations to deploy more rapidly on a single
    commodity hardware platform for both compute and storage infrastructure.
    Until recently this was something that was difficult to do with Open
    Source software. This presentation provides an overview of what a
    converged infrastructure solution looks like and then digs into the Open
    Source software that can be used to build successful converged
    solutions. With Gluster and oVirt as foundational software packages the
    presentation will dig into advanced scenarios for deploying virtual
    machines as well as adding additional nodes for both storage and
    compute. OpenStack networking, image management, and object store will
    be tied in as well to demonstrate the advantages of using Open Source to
    solve your organization's virtualization challenges.

- title: 'Thinking Beyond RDBMS: Building Polyglot Persistence Java Applications'
  speaker: Shekhar Gulati
  start: 2013-10-21 17:40 IST
  end: 2013-10-21 17:40 IST
  description: |
    Time has come to start thinking about multiple data storage solutions
    while building applications. A single application can use multiple data
    storage technologies depending on its use case -- right tool for right
    job. The session will start by introducing polyglot persistence to the
    audience. Next we will cover the pros and cons of Polyglot persistence.
    Then we will see how to build location aware Job search application
    using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Solr. The different data storage
    solutions are used to persist different types of data like MongoDB to
    store Job data along with its location, PostgreSQL to store User data,
    Redis as a cache for User objects and other goodies, and Solr as a full
    text search engine. Finally, the application will be deployed to
    OpenShift -- open source Platform as a Service.

- title: 'Controlling Clouds: Beyond Safety'
  speaker: Gordon Haff
  start: 2013-10-22 12:10 IST
  end: 2013-10-22 12:10 IST
  description: |
    As an industry, we’ve mostly moved on from naive notions about cloud
    computing being inherently “safe” or “risky.” However, more
    sophisticated discussions require both greater nuance and greater rigor.
    This presentation takes attendees through frameworks for evaluating and
    mitigating potential issues in hybrid cloud environments, discusses key
    risk factors to consider, and describes some of the relevant standards
    and provider certifications. This is a broad and sometimes complex
    topic. However, it’s very manageable if individual risk factors are
    considered systematically and specifically. This session will give IT
    professionals tools and knowledge to help them make informed decisions.

- title: Notes on Taking KVM-on-KVM Nested Virtualization for a Spin
  speaker: Kashyap Chamarthy
  start: 2013-10-22 12:10 IST
  end: 2013-10-22 12:10 IST
  description: |
    Nested Virtualzation involves three levels -- The physical host (L0),
    running a guest hypervisor (L1), and its associated 'nested' guest (L2).
    This is useful in several ways: a cloud user can get a guest hypervisor
    and can manage a variety of guests for development/test without the
    intervention of the cloud provider; enable live migration of
    hypervisors; ability to have an entire virtualization setup - a
    hypervisor and all its guests in a single virtual machine. Support for
    nVMX (Intel based Nested Virtualization) was first introduced around two
    years ago in KVM. Since then, there have been improvements in the
    Kernel, and also in the hardware space. This session discusses
    observations from recent testing of some workloads with upstream KVM
    with newest Intel hardware in a Linux-on-Linux environment. Finally, a
    glimpse of upcoming improvements in this space.

- title: GlusterFS Architect & Roadmap
  speaker: Vijay Bellur
  start: 2013-10-22 12:10 IST
  end: 2013-10-22 12:10 IST
  description: |
    GlusterFS is a general purpose distributed scale-out filesystem that
    runs on commodity hardware. In this presentation, Vijay Bellur will
    provide an architectural overview of GlusterFS and discuss how this
    architecture can be used to build a scale-out storage solution for
    modern datacenter needs. Details on new features , use cases and
    interesting challenges with GlusterFS will be provided. As part of this
    session, Vijay will also discuss integration of GlusterFS with other
    open source ecosystems like OpenStack, Apache Hadoop, oVirt and provide
    future directions of the GlusterFS project.

- title: 'Linux and New Storage Challenges: Adapting to Faster and Larger Storage'
  speaker: Rich Wheeler
  start: 2013-10-22 12:10 IST
  end: 2013-10-22 12:10 IST
  description: |
    Linux is usually the first target for vendors with the most cutting edge
    types of storage and file system technologies. The community was the
    first to bring parallel NFS into production quality and has been at the
    bleeding edge of dealing with very high speed, low latency storage
    devices like PCI-e SSDs. This talk gives an overview of two new
    technologies at the opposite ends of the speed and capacity spectrum:
    DRAM class persistent memory and very dense "shingled" drives. The talk
    gives an overview of what the technologies are, what the ongoing work is
    in upstream and some of the choices we have in supporting these new
    devices. Finally, the talk will give an overview of how these new
    technologies are likely to be deployed both in traditional, enterprise
    servers and in the hardware that underpins modern cloud systems.

- title: 'Raspberry Pi: Getting Started and Creative Applications'
  speaker: Ruth Suehle
  start: 2013-10-22 13:10 IST

  description: |
    The Raspberry Pi was designed as an inexpensive device to teach kids
    Python. It's become a device of choice for hardware tinkerers and
    hackers of all sorts of experience levels to integrate a fully
    functional Linux computer into their projects. I'll give you some
    inspiration with a few project ideas. Then I'll start with the basic,
    most important Pi tricks, like making sure you have the right SD card
    and that you've chosen the best distro for the job you intend to do up
    through some more challenging problems, like what happens when you need
    to build a cross-compiler or a custom kernel. Not that those things are
    crucial to having fun with a Pi, and whether you're new to the board or
    already used it to power your home automation system, you'll learn a few
    new ideas in this session.

- title: Systemd-Nspawn is Chroot on Steroids
  speaker: Lennart Poettering
  start: 2013-10-22 16:50 IST
  end: 2013-10-22 16:50 IST
  description: |
    systemd-nspawn is a simple container manager for Linux systems that is
    shipped as built-in component of systemd. systemd-nspawn is as easy to
    use as chroots, but suitable for booting up full-blown Linux systems.
    It's great as light-weight container tool that just works.
    systemd-nspawn makes working with containers easy. In this presentation
    I will introduce you to systemd-nspawn, and show how you can set up a
    bootable Linux container in a one command, and then boot it up in a
    second one -- and all that with built-in tools of your favourite
    (systemd-based) distribution. You might learn a thing or two about Linux
    containers in general, and the technology they build on. We'll discuss
    how we are working on integrating container support as closely into the
    core OS as possible, trying to provide similar integration as Zones on
    Solaris.

- title: Scripting And Integration with the oVirt Engine
  speaker: Oved Ourfali
  start: 2013-10-23 12:05 IST
  end: 2013-10-23 12:05 IST
  description: |
    In this session i'll provide different types of users with the tools to
    integrate with the oVirt virtualization management environment. I'll
    describe the different APIs relevant for each user type, including the
    REST API, the different SDKs and the CLI, providing a lot of useful
    examples, and how-tos. I'll also describe how can one use Deltacloud's
    different APIs in order to do various operations on the oVirt engine,
    using ""cloudy"" interfaces such as CIMI and EC2 API.

- title: A Language for Enhancing File System Tests
  speaker: Andrew Price
  start: 2013-10-23 13:05 IST
  end: 2013-10-23 13:05 IST
  description: |
    Effectively expressing the nature of file system corruption is an
    important part in file systems development, testing and bug fixing. In
    this presentation, Andy Price will introduce a language which can be
    used to specify focused changes to on-disk structures in gfs2 file
    systems, in order to create human-readable fault-injection tests, and
    outline possible further developments and uses.

- title: Recent Developments in GFS2
  speaker: Steven Whitehouse
  start: 2013-10-23 13:05 IST
  end: 2013-10-23 13:05 IST
  description: |
    The GFS2 cluster filesystem has been under development for a number of
    years, however there has been no uptodate presentation covering all of
    the latest features since OLS 2007. The intent of this talk is to
    provide an overview of the current feature set, noting recent
    significant developments, as well as an introduction into the major
    algorithms of GFS2 for those less familiar with its capabilities. During
    the development process, many lessons were learned which would apply
    equally to any open source project, and these will be discussed too.

- title: It was Never About Innovation
  speaker: John Mark Walker
  start: 2013-10-23 15:30 IST
  end: 2013-10-23 15:30 IST
  description: |
    Cloud computing as an industry phenomenon is built almost entirely on
    open source pieces, but ironically (or perhaps, perversely) is used to
    create proprietary services. This talk shows how the four software
    freedoms achieved a more level playing field for software users and
    developers and provided a solid foundation on which innovation
    flourished. Innovation was an interesting by-product, not something
    pursued. Unfortunately, the four software freedoms are not enough to
    compel open cloud services. The lessons learned from open source should
    be used to achieve a level playing field in cloud computing.

- title: Make Your Mobile Web App Go Hybrid with Apache Cordova
  speaker: Shekhar Gulati
  start: 2013-10-23 17:50 IST
  end: 2013-10-23 17:50 IST
  description: |
    Should you learn a new skill set to develop mobile applications? Or can
    you use your existing skillset and convert your HTML5 + REST mobile web
    app to hybrid app? Learning a new skill set can be very frustrating and
    time consuming. In this session Shekhar Gulati, Principal OpenShift
    Evangelist, will walk through the steps you will need to convert an
    existing HTML5 + RESTful Web application to a Hybrid app using Apache
    Cordova. Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile
    applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Restful backend of the
    application will be running on OpenShift -- Red Hat's open source public
    Platform as a Service.
