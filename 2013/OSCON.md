##The Linux Way: Rebuilding The Unix Way for a New Era
### Name: Andy Grover

The original UNIX philosophy could be summed up: “Write programs that do one
thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to
handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.”

Linux, as a “UNIX clone”, supports a command line environment that a
1970s-era Unix hacker would find familiar — sed, awk, ps, and the rest
are all there. But Linux has not stood still since catching up with
proprietary UNIX. Using Linux for new jobs on new categories of
computers has led us to extend the platform to suit our needs.

  * Is text still a “universal interface”, or is it now HTML? HTTP? Or JSON?
  * Should programs work together as filters, or via APIs?
  * Do we even need to care about portability any more?

This talk will cover some of the ways the Linux platform has moved away
from the Unix philosophy, while still holding true to some fundamental
values, and how we users and hackers are defining a new Linux Way,
distinct from the Unix Way.
