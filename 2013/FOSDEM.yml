- title: QEMU USB status report 2012
  speaker: Hans de Goede
  start: 2013-02-02 11:00 CET
  end: 2013-02-02 11:30 CET

    This talk gives an overview on the state of the QEMU USB subsystem. What
    happened last year? What are the plans for the future? Where do we stand
    in terms of USB 3.0 support?

    The intended audience are people who are interested in USB in virtual
    machines (vusb) both developers and users. The audience is expected to
    be familiar with generic virtualization concepts, but no deep technical
    knowledge is required.

    Speaker self introduction: Hans has been a Linux developer since 1996,
    working on a wide variety of projects, including maintaining 200
    packages in Fedora, various hwmon kernel drivers, rewriting and merging
    many out of tree webcam drivers into the mainline kernel, libv4l a
    userspace library to transparently handle the decompression of many
    proprietary webcam video formats in userspace.

    Since 2008 Hans works for Red Hat, besides continuing all the FOSS work
    he did before, at Red Hat he has worked on anaconda the Fedora / Red Hat
    installer, parted (the partition tool) and currently works on Spice and
    USB-redirection under QEMU.

- title: Using Personas to Target Users
  speaker: Dave Neary
  start: 2013-02-02 12:15 CET

  description: |
    Personas were made famous by Alan Moore in "The Inmates are Running the
    Asylum", a seminal book on user interface design for computer
    programmers. They have been used for decades in the marketing industry
    to help target specific market segments with ads and products. Personas
    help you frame feature discussions while developing your software, guide
    your communication and conference strategy, and ultimately help you to
    have a more popular, better project.

    This presentation will cover the basics of:

    * What is a persona?
    * How do I come up with one (or several) for my project?
    * What can I do with them?

- title: (R)evolution of Java Packaging in GNU/Linux
  speaker: Mikołaj Izdebski and Stanislav Ochotnický
  start: 2013-02-02 12:30 CET
  end: 2013-02-02 13:00 CET
  description: |
    Java packaging in Linux has never been trivial. Partially due to strict
    principles that most Linux distributions adhere to, partially due to
    Java ecosystem encouraging behavior which goes against these principles,
    but mostly due to ineffective tooling on both sides of the fence.

    Over past 2 years, tooling and guidelines for packaging Java have
    changed in Fedora Linux considerably. What used to be a 1000 line build
    script can soon become 100 lines of mostly metadata. But all of that
    relies on sane build system with predictable behavior on Java side:
    Maven.

    During the course of the talk we will clean up one such build script and
    describe how each change was made possible. Most importantly we hope to
    convince the audience that for common good, using Maven for Java
    development even with all its quirks is better than the alternatives. A
    wider discussion on Java build systems would also be welcome.

  speaker: Federico Simoncelli
  start: 2013-02-02 13:30 CET
  end: 2013-02-02 14:00 CET
  description: |
    Live storage migration, one of the newest features introduced in oVirt,
    is the capability of moving virtual disks from one storage device to
    another without interrupting the guest operations. This presentation
    will cover in detail the entire low level design and implementation and
    all the technical challenges associated with them. In a virtualization
    world where the guest services cannot be stopped for maintenance, live
    storage migration is the best tool you can have.

- title: Porting OpenJDK to AArch64
  speaker: Andrew Haley and Andrew Dinn
  start: 2013-02-02 14:00 CET
  end: 2013-02-02 14:40 CET
  description: "ARM's new, 64 bit ARMv8 architecture, is a break from the past in
    two\nregards. The change of scale from 32 to 64 bit implies a broadening of\nARM's
    target market from (mostly) embedded devices to address the\nrequirements of high
    end consumer devices and servers. The 64 bit mode\n(AArch64) programming model
    is significantly different from the existing\n32 bit model.\n\nIf ARM's change
    of direction does indeed grab a significant share of\nthis market then there are
    two corresponding implications for the Free\nJava community. We need a high quality
    free Java implementation to\nensure that the market is not colonised solely by
    commercial Java\nvendors. We need to provide this implementation from scratch
    rather than\ntry to modify existing 32 bit Java implementations.\n\nRed Hat has
    decided to port OpenJDK to AArch64 precisely to meet these\nimplications head
    on.\n\nThis talk will describe the significant progress we have made in porting\nOpenJDK
    to AArch64 since the project began in earnest in July 2012, even\nthough real
    hardware is not yet available and will not be for many\nmonths to come.\n\nDuring
    the talk we will:\n\n-  \n\nOutline our plan for converting the runtime JIT components
    of OpenJDK to\ngenerate AArch64 code -- the (generated AArch64 code) template\ninterpreter
    and the C1/C2 JIT compilers\n\n-  \n\nExplain how we have already managed to execute
    and debug generated ARM\ncode using our own ARMv8 functional simulator integrated
    into an x86 JVM\n\n-  \n\nDisplay execution of a Java program using the template
    interpreter\nrunning on our simulator\n\n-  \n\nShow both ARM instruction-level
    and Java bytecode-level stepping and\ndebugging of generated code within gdb"

- title: LNST - Automated and Portable Network Tests
  speaker: Radek Pazdera
  start: 2013-02-02 14:20 CET
  end: 2013-02-02 15:00 CET
  description: |
    In this presentation, we would like to introduce a tool we have been
    working on for the last couple of months. Our main goal is to make
    networking tests and reproducers as automated and portable as possible.

    Testing network stacks requires a fair amount of configuration to be
    done on multiple machines. The configuration itself is a part of the
    test. However, it is often highly dependent on the environment and
    unfortunately, when the environment changes (due to move to a different
    hardware/site, changes in the addressing, or simply updates of the
    operating system) the configuration often breaks.

    With LNST, we try to overcome these problems of transferring network
    configuration between different environments. We will demonstrate the
    ideas and the concepts we are working with, as well as the features that
    are a part of Linux Network Stack Test.

- title: MoM as host level enforcement agent
  speaker: Doron Fediuck
  start: 2013-02-02 14:30 CET
  end: 2013-02-02 15:00 CET
  description: |
    Maintaining QoS in cloud computing requires host-level monitoring and
    policy enforcement. In order to be able to scale up large setups, a
    host-level agent is needed to supervise and dynamically handle the VMs
    resource consumption based on the SLA policy.

    In this session we'll look at MoM, and get in-depth view of its
    integration with VDSM and functionalities. Participants will be able to
    get insights on memory overcommitment in hypervisors and the way memory
    balloon device is being used to achieve overcommitment.

- title: oVirt introduction

    This session will provide an intro to the oVirt project components and
    features. The oVirt Project is an open virtualization project providing
    a feature-rich server and desktop virtualization management platform
    with advanced capabilities for hosts and guests, including high
    availability, live migration, storage management, system scheduler, and
    more. oVirt provides an integration point for several open source
    virtualization technologies, including KVM, libvirt, spice and oVirt
    node. oVirt was launched in November 2011 as a fully open source
    project, based on assets from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
    platform. The project has an open governance model, and initial board
    has members from IBM, Cisco, NetApp, Red Hat and SUSE.

- title: Return of the Shark
  speaker: Roman Kennke
  start: 2013-02-02 15:40 CET
  end: 2013-02-02 16:10 CET
  description: |
    Since mid-2011 (when Gary Benson, the original author of Zero/Shark)
    left Red Hat's Java team), the Zero interpreter and Shark compiler have
    been basically unmaintained. A few months ago I picked up the project
    and fixed the outstanding issues (related to changes in Hotspot and
    LLVM) and started implementing a couple of significant improvements.

    This talk will give a short summary about what Zero and Shark actually
    are, how they work, why they are relevant (even in the face of upcoming
    full ports for PowerPC and others), how it fits in the OpenJDK
    ecosystem, and then describe some of the more interesting details about
    what I did, in particular improved support for atomic operations, JSR
    292/invokedynamic, interesting optimizations in both the compiler and
    the interpreter and more. Hopefully I will be able to present some
    interesting ports to other platforms like ARM or PowerPC, some
    benchmarks results as well as results from testsuites (TCK?). Finally,
    I'll give an outlook to the future, things that need to be done, open
    improvements, optimizations, etc.

    Headed to your annual developer conference and there’s a contentious
    topic on everyone’s mind? Wondering how to get past the airing of
    grievances into a useful discussion?

    In this talk, Lydia Pintscher and Leslie Hawthorn will explore
    facilitation techniques to use during community wide discussions.
    Drawing on the principles of [open space
    technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_technology) they
    will explore several methods for achieving consensus while still having
    fun, including:

    * Spectragrams
    * Dot-o-cracy
    * Post-It
    * Mind mapping
    * more

    The talk will be accompanied by live demos of each technique. Audience
    participation will be requested but not required. Participants who wish
    to learn more about the topics to be discussed in advance of the
    presentation may wish to visit [the Aspiration Technology
    wiki](http://facilitation.aspiration.org) for more details.

    GlusterFS is a distributed file system that can scale to several
    petabytes. oVirt is a management platform for Kernel based Virtual
    Machine (KVM) and can be used to manage GlusterFS as well.

    This talk will focus on GlusterFS integration with oVirt. GlusterFS and
    KVM virtualization users and developers will be able to get more
    information on GlusterFS concepts, enabling it in oVirt for
    virtualization, a short overview of oVirt and VDSM architecture
    including VDSM storage concepts. This will be followed by GlusterFS as a
    VDSM Storage Domain, as well as GlusterFS domain support in oVirt
    engine.

  description: |
    This presentation examines current challenges in Open Source security
    and sketches ideas to address them.

    Linux distributions deal with a large number of code bases predominantly
    written by others, some of them huge. This makes it difficult to address
    vulnerabilities in a consistent fashion. There is increasing demand for
    difficult-to-use technology, such as cryptography, and more and more
    upstream projects are forced to deal with vulnerabilities in their code.

- title: How to build an Identity Management System on Linux
  speaker: Simo Sorce
  start: 2013-02-02 17:00 CET
  end: 2013-02-02 17:50 CET
  description: |
    How do you build a comprehensive and coherent Identity Management System
    on Linux? This is the question I started answering 7 years ago when I
    joined Red Hat, and is still being worked on today. In this talk I will
    present a broad overview of all the aspects of Identity Management that
    need to be considered to have a full end-to-end solution, for the server
    components (Kerberos, LDAP, DNS, Management components, etc..) that are
    managed under the umbrella of the FreeIPA project to the client
    components (SSSD and utilities) and all the other hidden parts (like
    GSS-Proxy, Samba libraries) that are normally not easily visible but
    that become needed once you get down to playing with the bits. The talk
    will go down into the technical details and the whys and hows of the
    whole architecture.

- title: Supporting and Using EC2/CIMI on top of Cloud Environments

  description: |
    In this presentation I'll describe some standard and common cloud APIs
    such as EC2 and CIMI, and show how one can use Deltacloud in order to
    support them on top of cloud environments. As an example, I'll show how
    to add this support and use it on top of the oVirt engine.

    In this presentation I'll show how one can use the new oVirt-Engine
    UI-Plugin infrastructure, to add a Foreman-UI-plugin, that allows
    querying Foreman information on oVirt entities, and preform different
    Foreman-related operations on them.

- title: 'OpenStack: 21st Century App Architecture and Cloud Operations'
  speaker: Mark McLoughlin
  start: 2013-02-03 10:00 CET
  end: 2013-02-03 10:25 CET
  description: |
    The advent of IaaS has brought about a new style of application
    architecture built around the idea that the components of your
    architecture should be fine-grained programmable resources. This allows
    applications to be resilient and scalable, but also allows the operation
    of the application to be fully automated.

    Mark will discuss how OpenStack was designed from the ground up with
    these same principles in mind and can be deployed in a highly resilient
    and fault tolerant manner. Mark will go on to explain how you should aim
    to build on OpenStack's architecture so that operating an OpenStack
    cloud is as automated as operating a modern cloud based application.

  description: |
    A tale of sadness and a tale of joy: the tale of invokedynamic use in
    JRuby and a few other projects since the first prototypes dropped in
    2008. I started experimenting with invokedynamic in JRuby in version
    1.1.5, early in the JSR-292 process, and kept up with changes as they
    arrived. Today, JRuby utilizes invokedynamic for several aspects of the
    Ruby language, and we're finding more ways to use it every day. I'll
    talk about where we've been and where we're going...what works and what
    doesn't...and how to understand everything happening under the covers.

  description: |
    The systemd project is now two years old (almost three). It found
    adoption as the core of many big community and commercial Linux
    distributions. It's time to look back what we achieved, what we didn't
    achieve, how we dealt with the various controversies, and what's to come
    next.

  description: |
    Last year, we shared with the Free Java and the global OSS community our
    vision for a new open source monitoring and instrumentation tool for
    anyone running an open Java stack, along with our fledgeling
    implementation. Since then, we've been hard at work making this vision a
    reality. Our project has undergone various transformations, including
    becoming modular not just in terms of deployment but also from a source
    code perspective with the help of OSGi, a complete overhaul of the API
    for extending Thermostat, and an amazing visual makeover -- attendees
    from last year may have trouble recognizing it on sight. Along the way
    we've also added new, compelling features such as detailed thread
    monitoring, heap dump and analysis, an Eclipse plugin interface, and
    more functionality available from the command line. Of course, we also
    had a lot of fun doing it.

    In our talk, we will describe the current state of Thermostat, give a
    demo of what you can do out of the box, and build a toy plugin on the
    spot so that attendees can see how easy it is to add custom
    instrumentation.

  description: |
    So, you have a crazy new idea you'd like to try but you need an
    application server to run it? Of course, you also need to store your
    data in MySQL, PostgreSQL... or maybe even in MongoDB? Are you also
    looking for Continuous Integration?

    In this session, you'll see how OpenShift Origin, Red Hat's open source
    PaaS lets you easily deploy your Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby or Python
    applications on your own infrastructure. You'll also see how it
    integrates with JBoss Tools to seamlessly code and then publish without
    leaving your Eclipse IDE.

  description: |
    In the LibreOffice component architecture, with UNO service information
    changed from active to passive, XML-based representation a while ago,
    UNO type information is the remaining topic that needs some love,
    clean-up, and improvement. From a curiously verbose UNOIDL syntax, to
    the awkward binary .rdb format, to the fact that type information is
    duplicated in different formats for binary UNO and Java UNO, all the way
    to the still unsolved great challenge of becoming incompatible
    compatibly, etc. etc. -- you get the idea.

  description: |
    In a world where Cloud IaaS providers are popping up on every street
    corner, it becomes increasingly important to prevent vendor lock-in.
    Several efforts are already underway in projects like Deltacloud to help
    abstract away the differences in APIs and allow consumers to be cloud
    agnostic.

    However, the desire for cloud agnosticism becomes increasingly
    challenging when we start thinking about managing images. Not only do we
    have API differences, but also many cloud vendors require differing
    formats and importation methods, some requiring uploading of pre-built
    images, others snapshots of running instances.

    This talk addresses some of the issues surrounding image management in a
    federated cloud environment and introduces Aeolus Image Factory; a
    project that offers image management abstraction for multitude of Cloud
    vendors. Aeolus Image Factory allows users to define images at a high
    level and have them built, pushed and registered with all the major
    cloud vendors.

  end: 2013-02-03 15:55 CET
  description: |
    Deploying complex systems on OpenStack can be a challenge.

    A small website running MediaWiki can happily fit on a single server,
    but the same software running at the Wikipedia scale is much more
    demanding. You need to deal with multiple database servers, web servers,
    load balancers, failover, networking configuration, IP address
    assignment and more.

    The Heat project allows you to describe all the resources and their
    relationships in a single template, launch everything with one command
    and keep it up. You can easily combine the workflow with existing
    configuration management tools such as Puppet or Chef.

    Initially modeled after Amazon CloudFormation, Heat is a free and open
    source component for OpenStack and has recently been accepted into
    OpenStack incubation.

    This session will provide an overview of Heat's capabilities and how to
    use them, followed by a live demonstration. At the end you will
    understand Heat well enough to decide whether it is useful in your
    environment and how to get started with it.

    Many GNU/Linux distributions include a cross-compilation environment for
    Windows that is easy to install and use. Some of these also provide the
    Nullsoft installer (NSIS) to package build artifacts into a Windows
    executable. NSIS has the advantage that the compiler is portable to
    POSIX systems, but does not support corporate deployment and component
    management as well as .msi packages generated for the Windows Installer.
    libmsi is a port of Wine's MSI database code. The talk will present the
    rationale for the library, its current state and msitools, a small set
    of programs that we implemented around it. We will also present plans
    for future development of libmsi and msitools, and its inclusion in
    Fedora-MinGW project.

  description: |
    Ceilometer is an OpenStack incubated project which started in April 2012
    with the goal to provide a unique interface point to provide measurement
    in OpenStack. Our purpose for measurement started with a focus on
    metering (for billing) and has since been extended to other targets such
    as monitoring and alerting. This project is a collaboration of a wide
    variety of actors.

    After a brief introduction of the project past and future, this talk
    will introduce the audience to the project's architecture before digging
    into how and why they can contribute to its future.

  description: |
    Photos is an application to access, organize and share your photos with
    GNOME 3. After Documents it is the latest among the new breed of Finding
    & Reminding applications. Like other core GNOME applications, it targets
    a new GNOME 3 style: cloud integration, fresh UI elements and touch
    enablement.

    This talk will outline the use cases and principles, how it relates to

    Whilst the mantra of free and open source software communities focus on
    transparency and collaboration, community leaders will often find that
    the most significant conversations are those they have 1/1 and "behind
    closed doors." As a community leader, one is called upon to be both
    trusted confidant and change agent, and being effective in both roles
    simultaneously can be a quite difficult -- and deeply humorous -- dance.
    Join Leslie Hawthorn as she explores the nuances of public and private
    discourse in FOSS projects, using real world examples from her
    experience interacting with more than 200 communities over the past six
    years.
