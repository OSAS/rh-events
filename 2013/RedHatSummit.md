## Community Catalysts: The Value of Open Source Community Development
### Name: Dave Neary
### Time: June 12, 2013 15:40 - 16:40 EDT
### Room: 209

Red Hat products are built on open source software. Unlike proprietery software,
open source software provides the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the code,
giving customers an opportunity to engage in the product development process and
preview future Red Hat products.

In this session, Dave Neary will discuss community projects that Red Hat has
sponsored and participated in, including oVirt, OpenStack, JBoss Application Server,
LibreOffice, GNOME, and Fedora. Attendees will:

* Discover the benefits of using community-developed software and engaging with upstream communities
* Learn about how French services company AlterWay built a public cloud offering on oVirt
* Preview upcoming Red Hat product features
* Learn about how to influence the development of future features by working directly with the developers
