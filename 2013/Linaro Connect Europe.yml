    The technical benefits of the open source model are widely known: a
    wider pool of talent than any one company could bring to bear on a
    particular problem, the ability to focus more energy on key product
    differentiators rather than creating and maintaining foundational
    elements, and higher quality source code. From a technical perspective,
    open source has triumphed and ushered in a new era of development
    practices and methodologies that allow disparate groups with different
    and, often, conflicting agendas to work together effectively, creating
    better works, faster. Despite its successes, the practice of open source
    development remains challenging in many of its social aspects: achieving
    the best possible consensus amongst various parties, navigating the
    cultural differences inherent in working with a global team and dealing
    with contentious contributors. To put it another way, software and
    hardware are 'easy', people are difficult.

    Drawing on years of experience working with hundreds of open source
    projects, Leslie Hawthorn will explore best practices for cultivating
    community cohesion, including:

    * Creating consensus among different groups
    * Mitigating conflicts that arise due to different cultural norms
    * Smoothing the waters after hard conversations and argument
