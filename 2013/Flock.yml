  For eight years, Fedora users and developers have gathered at an event
  named for them, the Fedora Users and Developers conference (FUDCon). But
  we’ve grown, and it’s time for a new approach: Flock.

  Flock is a brand new conference where Fedora contributors can come
  together, discuss new ideas, work to make those ideas a reality, and
  continue to promote the core values of the Fedora community: Freedom,
  Friends, Features, and First.

  Fedora and the people who participate in the project encompass so much
  more than just an interest in Linux. Flock is where you meet with other
  members of the Fedora community who share whatever your interest is,
  whether that’s the kernel or the cloud, hardware or UX design. We also
  want to embrace and invite the growing open hardware community so that
  we can learn from one another and create better things together.

  The first Flock will be held August 9-12, 2013 in Charleston, SC. While
  you may be accustomed to the FUDCon barcamp model, Flock will operate
  more like a traditional conference. We invite you to submit a talk by
  May 31.

  Just like Fedora, Flock will be thinking big. This conference will have
  four full days of talks, workshops, hackfests and sprints, We hope to
  have scheduled sessions covering these and other topics:

  - Cloud
  - Community
  - Design
  - Desktop
  - Embedded
  - Fonts
  - Gaming
  - Infrastructure
  - Marketing
  - Open hardware
  - Quality & Testing
  - Security
  - Special Interest Groups

  And even if you’re not interested in submitting a talk, we hope you’ll
  join us for the first of this new event. Subscribe to the mailing list
  to receive updates.

  You’ll find your flock here.
