    OpenDaylight is an exciting new community-led, open source project
    focused on accelerating adoption of software-defined networking (SDN) by
    providing a robust SDN platform on which the industry can build and
    innovate. An OpenDaylight controller provides flexible management of
    both physical and virtual networks. The open source nature of the
    project and its flexible network management capabilities make it an
    ideal SDN platform to integrate with Neutron.

    In this session, OpenDaylight community members from Cisco, IBM, RedHat,
    and Ericsson will describe the OpenDaylight project goals and platform
    architecture, as well as the roadmap and progress to date. OpenDaylight
    brings together a number of virtual networking approaches, and we will
    discuss integration approaches with OpenStack Neutron that provide
    flexibility for OpenStack administrators and users. Details of our
    initial Neutron integration will also be demonstrated for attendees.

    Attendees will leave this session with a greater understanding of what
    OpenDaylight is, and how it can integrate with OpenStack Neutron to
    provide a powerful SDN-based networking solution for OpenStack Clouds.

- title: 'OpenStack for Enterprise Developers: Should they care?'

    OpenStack has experienced a phenomenal growth, but, can it make the leap
    from 10s of thousands of community members to 10s of millions? Many
    large software ecosystems that have thrived recently have been powered
    by developers. So far, enterprise developers have remained largely in
    the periphery as far as OpenStack is concerned although there are
    serveral use cases like SDLC, Big Data, PaaS atop OpenStack, Hybrid
    cloud development, etc. that is aimed squarely at developers. Perhaps,
    IaaS will never be interesting to developers? Can some of the newer
    initiatives (like Heat) change this?

    Attend this panel to hear different perspectives of should OpenStack
    appeal to enterprise developers and if so how. Please be armed with the
    tough questions and opinions of what does OpenStack mean to enterprise
    developers. These stackers have worked with large ecosystem of
    developers in their past lives and represent different parts of the
    OpenStack ecosystem. More than anything they are not hesitant to speak
    their mind and so should you.

- title: Unifying the Management of OpenStack, Public Cloud, Data Center Virtualization
    and more

  description: |
    Adding an OpenStack environment into an already complex IT architecture
    threatens to overwhelm IT staff who are already spending countless hours
    managing existing IT architectures. Is it possible to unify the
    operational management of existing data center virtualization with an
    OpenStack deployment? What about adding a public cloud provider into the
    mix? What about adding Platform as a Service capabilities? In this
    session, Oleg and James will demonstrate how CloudForms can provide a
    unified operational management framework for all of these scenarios and
    help IT staff keep their sanity in the process. Subjects explained will
    include how to:

    * Discover and monitor new and existing OpenStack environments
    * Provide Showback and Chargeback of guest workloads
    * Provision workloads via self-service catalogs to OpenStack
    * Create migration analysis reports from datacenter virtualization
    platforms (including Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Microsoft
    Hyper-V, VMware vSphere) to OpenStack

    James and Oleg will also provide an overview of Red Hat's Open Hybrid
    Cloud Architecture and CloudForms' upstream open source community.
    Attendees will leave this session with a solid understanding of how to
    unify operations management of OpenStack with existing data center
    virtualization and public clouds in their organization.

- title: Real World Usage of GlusterFS + OpenStack
  speaker: John Mark Walker, Eric Harney
  start: 2013-11-08 09:00 UTC
  end: 2013-11-08 09:00 UTC
  description: |
    The Gluster community has been working hard to ensure GlusterFS is
    integrated with each OpenStack storage interface. With that integration,
    as well as the latest VM image management features, GlusterFS 3.4 is now
    a first-class citizen of the OpenStack ecosystem.

    In this workshop, Eric Harney and John Mark Walker will demonstrate how
    to deploy OpenStack with GlusterFS as a scale-out storage platform
    _today._ They will also detail the four major areas of focus for
    integration:

    Swift: A GlusterFS-backed storage platform has been implemented for the
    Swift API using the upstream Swift proxy server/API layer. This provides
    a unified storage backend for object as well as POSIX data.

    Glance: While it has been possible to use a mounted GlusterFS volume as
    the backend data store for Glance for some time, recent development work
    has enabled an integrated deployment with Cinder, significantly
    increasing the performance for deploying VM images on GlusterFS volumes.

    Cinder: A Cinder integration for the Grizzly release added an option for
    deploying live VM images on GlusterFS volumes. With recent contributions
    to the Havana release, you can now utilize the QEMU - libgfapi
    integration that was released in GlusterFS 3.4, greatly improving the
    performance of VM image management on GlusterFS.

    Libgfapi: With the release of GlusterFS 3.4, the libgfapi client library
    is now the standard way to integrate applications with GlusterFS.

    Following simple examples, Eric and John Mark will demonstrate:

    How to deploy a GlusterFS-backed object storage solution, referencing
    when and why you should use this solution in conjunction with or in lieu
    of the Swift object storage implementation

    How to access the same data via NFS, libgfapi, the GlusterFS client, and
    the Swift API

    The power and flexibility of Libgfapi

    In addition, they will provide a brief GlusterFS roadmap tour,
    discussing upcoming enhancements that will benefit OpenStack operators
    and developers.

    Come to this session to get an update on Marconi, an OpenStack queuing
    and notification service described at wiki.openstack.org/marconi

    Marconi aims to be pragmatic, building upon the real-world experiences
    of teams who have solid track records running and supporting web-scale
    message queuing systems. Users can customize Marconi to achieve a wide
    range of performance, durability, availability, and efficiency goals.

    As a message bus, Marconi allows cloud developers to use a REST API to
    easily distribute tasks to multiple workers across the components of an
    OpenStack deployment. Publish-subscribe semantics are also supported,
    allowing notifications to be distributed to multiple listeners at once.

    Join Rackspace's Kurt Griffiths, Principal Architect, and Allan Metts,
    Engineering Director, to learn about the work that has been done and the
    path ahead -- including a description of the project, real-world
    performance metrics, and a live demo.

- title: OpenStack Neutron Modular Layer 2 Plugin Deep Dive

  description: |
    This presentation introduces the Havana release's new Modular Layer 2
    (ML2) plugin for OpenStack Neutron. The ML2 plugin is a community-driven
    framework allowing OpenStack Neutron to simultaneously utilize the
    variety of layer 2 networking technologies found in complex, real-world
    data centers. ML2 currently works with the Open vSwitch, Linux Bridge,
    and Hyper-V L2 agents, and is intended to replace and deprecate those
    agents' monolithic plugins. The ML2 plugin also works with SDN
    controllers and network hardware devices, and is designed to greatly
    simplify adding support for new L2 networking technologies into
    OpenStack Neutron.

    In this session, Cisco and Red Hat representatives will:

    * Introduce the Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plugin for OpenStack Neutron
    * Provide an overview of ML2, discussing its design principles and
    detailing use case examples
    * Describe ML2's architecture and its driver APIs
    * Demonstrate an OpenStack deployment with ML2 utilizing multiple
    segmentation methods and multiple L2 networking mechanisms to show the
    power of the ML2 plugin

    Attendees will leave this session with an understanding of ML2, the use
    cases it was designed to solve, how to deploy ML2 in an OpenStack Havana
    environment, and how existing Neutron deployments can migrate to ML2.

- title: 'OpenStack user personas: 6 months on'

    Earlier this year, Dave Neary presented the theory of personas to
    attendees of the OpenStack Summit in Portland. Attendees were excited
    about creating a set of personas for the OpenStack project, as they
    allow you to have a much clearer idea of your target audience, what
    their needs are, and how you can reach them. They also allow much easier
    communication around feature discussions, user interface design and
    marketing strategy.

    Based on data from the user committee survey and user interviews, a
    personas working group is being created to answer the question: “Who
    uses OpenStack?” In this session Dave will return to present an initial
    set of OpenStack personas, discuss how they were created, and detail
    what conclusions we can draw from them.

    Ceilometer is a tool that collects usage and performance data, while
    Heat orchestrates complex deployments on top of OpenStack. Heat aims to
    autoscale its deployments, scaling up when they're running hot and
    scaling back when idle.

    Just getting a cloud environment up and running is no longer enough. The
    challenge that OpenStack faces is how to get people, applications and
    services working on OpenStack out of the box and to ensure that the
    “unboxing” experience is as seamless and painless as possible.
    Organizations expectations for deploying cloud now include being able to
    rapidly make services and applications available as soon as they have
    IaaS deployed.

    To meet the expectations of most organizations, adding a PaaS layer has
    become an essential part of every Cloud deployment strategy. The
    OpenShift Origin PaaS project is backed by the fastest growing
    open-source community of developers, cloud architects, devops, and end
    users intent on creating the next generation of PaaS and ensuring that
    the tools for deploying, managing & scaling it for OpenStack are freely
    available. To do this on OpenStack, the OpenShift community has
    “adopted” Heat, OpenStack's orchestration engine, and delivered a set of
    Heat templates for deploying, managing and auto-scaling OpenShift on any
    OpenStack distribution.

    This talk provides an overview of OpenShift, RedHat's Platform as a
    Service and a deep dive into deploying OpenShift using Heat, OpenStack's
    template language, and a live demonstration of Heat technologies to
    deploy AND autoscale OpenShift using repeatable orchestration templates.

    We will demonstrate the power of Heat, OpenStack's orchestration engine
    and how we leverage Heat to orchestrate cloud infrastructure resources
    such as storage, networking, and instances to deploy OpenShift into a
    repeatable running environment for OpenStack IaaS platforms.

    OpenStack Summit attendees can learn about both the OpenShift Origin
    Project, and the emerging Heat template technologies and its impact on
    Linux and open source cloud communities.

    The speakers are both experienced with live demonstrations, and make the
    technical difficulty of this topic easily approachable through real-life
    examples.
