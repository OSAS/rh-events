Sustainable Economy & Society
OI 2.0 Collaboration Partners

Open Innovation 2.0: Sustainable Economy & Society is a collaboration between the European Commission Open Innovation and Strategy Policy Group, Intel Labs Europe, Dublin City, Trinity College and many other stakeholders, organised in association with the Irish Presidency of the European Union 2013.

A new paradigm, Open Innovation 2.0 (OI2) can help to achieve the Europe 2020 vision.  It is based on principles of integrated collaboration, shared value, new innovation ecosystems and rapid adoption.  OI2 is the new paradigm for individuals and organisations to generate prosperity and harness the opportunities together. Enablers for this new paradigm are the exponential improvements in performance of ICT in parallel with globalization leading to significant increase in the rate and potential of interactions and possibilities for disruptive innovation.

Jim Jagielski of the Open Source and Standards team will be
speaking about how Open Source drives Open Innovation
and the Lessons Learned from decades on the FOSS world.
