Some of the best speakers in open source will again attend and participate – in a boutique, personal environment.

We’ll focus specifically on developers, system administrators and IT managers.  If you do any of this you’ll find excellent information in a session or training format.

We’ll focus on established technologies and topics, like Linux, Drupal, MySQL, LibreOffice, Security, Virtualization, Licensing and Patents.

We’ll focus on emerging technologies like Riak, MongoDB, Software Defined Networking, JavaScript, backbone.js, Python, Clojure, Couchbase and HTML5.

The biggest companies in the open source space will again attend and participate, including Mozilla, SIOS, SparkFun, Red Hat, Engine Yard, GitHub, ForgeRock, HP, and Google.

Jim Jagielski of the Open Source and Standards team will once again be presenting at POSSCON.
His session will focus on boiling down the various complex varieties of
community, governance, licensing and the like down to its basic components.
