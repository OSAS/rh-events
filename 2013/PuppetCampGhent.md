## Replacing that growing "exec" with a provider
### Name: Dominic Cleal
### Time: January 31, 2013 17:00 - 17:45 CET

Far too often we abuse the "exec" type, when what we really need is a simple provider that allows for more complex tests and exception handling.  This talk will show how to change that enormous "exec" resource to a new type and provider, then return your manifests to a declarative config description.
