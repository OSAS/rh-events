## Negotiation Theory for geeks
### Name: Dave Neary
### Room: TBA
### Time: Mon Jul 8 2013, 14:40 - 15:20 CEST

The best free software hackers are great at the "soft skills" related to 
hacking - resolving conflict, gathering support around a direction for 
the project, and understanding what the user *really* wants when filing 
a bug report. Every feature request and implementation discussion, bug 
report and mailing list thread is a negotiation.

There is a well established, common sense, very effective way to think 
of negotiations which will help you improve as a developer, and make 
your project better at the same time, from the Harvard Negotiation 
Project. In this talk, Leslie Hawthorn will provide an overview of 
negotiation theory and pointers to further resources. She will also 
explore the importance of *both* empathy and transparency in our 
communications as we look to make our free software project communities 
most successful.
