## Panel on Linux distributions: differences and commonalities
### Name: Aurélien Bompard
### Time: Friday April 5 2013, 14:00 - 15:00 CEST

One of the main criticisms made to Linux distributions is the duplication of efforts.
The purpose of this roundtable is to identify the reasons for the existence of these
multiple distributions, and especially to show what are the means used by their
communities to pool resources to reduce duplication of effort.

Aspects of governance, manufacturing software, integration of components, packaging
will be at the heart of this debate among stakeholders as well as the impacts and
observations offered by a Microsoft representative.
