with clearly defined roles that will be presented here.

In a second part, we present the applications provided to the contributors: from 
wiki system package building, through mailing lists, tracking tickets, the 
project manager, etc..

Finally, we give an overview of the technical outlook for Fedora infrastructure 
projects underway and those planned for the short and medium term.

## Panel on Linux distributions: differences and commonalities
### Name: Aurélien Bompard
### Time: Friday April 5 2013, 14:00 - 15:00 CEST

One of the main criticisms made to Linux distributions is the duplication of efforts. 
The purpose of this roundtable is to identify the reasons for the existence of these 
multiple distributions, and especially to show what are the means used by their 
communities to pool resources to reduce duplication of effort.

Aspects of governance, manufacturing software, integration of components, packaging 
will be at the heart of this debate among stakeholders as well as the impacts and 
observations offered by a Microsoft representative.
