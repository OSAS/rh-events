## Everything I Know About the Cloud, I Learned From Game of Thrones
### Name: Joe Brockmeier
### Time: September 18, 2013 14:00pm EST

George R. R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, and the HBO
television series, make for great entertainment - if a little bloody and
short on happy endings. Though the "Game of Thrones" characters inhabit
a universe that hasn't even seen gunpowder yet, a lot of the lessons
learned in GoT also apply to building, deploying, and maintaining an
IaaS cloud. This talk will take a humorous approach, but also give
attendees some crucial insights into moving from traditional IT to cloud
computing.
