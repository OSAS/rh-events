# Openmobility
## Location: Bratislava, Slovakia
## Date: Sat Apr 6 - 7 2013

Openmobility 2013 <http://www.openmobility.eu/en/>, Central Europe's leading conference 
for open mobile platforms and open source hardware, is taking place in Bratislava 
at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Bratislava University 
of Technology  <http://www.openmobility.eu/conference/om2013/venue/>. This year's conference
will see some of the leading experts and developers in the Czech, Slovak and international
Open Source community focusing on open mobile technology and open hardware. For the first
time, Openmobility is going to take a closer look at the quickly growing DIY and Maker 
movement. 

Presentations will be held in English, Czech or Slovak.

Several Red Hatters are going to give a talk in these areas, showing our leadership in
all different open source communities, even outside the main track of the company.


## What are open & mobile platforms and Open Source Hardware? A brief introduction.
### Name: Martin Holec and Jaroslav Řezník
### Room: Room A
### Time: Sat Apr 6 2013, 09:00 - 10:00 CEST

What does the "open & mobile" and the "open source hardware" terms stand for and why it's 
important to have trully open & mobile and open source hardware platforms? This talk will 
give you a brief overview of past and current offerings in these areas and hopefully 
a hope for the near future.

## RepRap & Fedora
### Name: Miro Hrončok
### Room: Room A
### Time: Sat Apr 6 2013, 10:00 - 11:00 CEST

Imagine a machine or tool. Imagine you can send a CAD model to that machine from your 
computer or cellphone, wait a while and get a real object, that you can hold in your hands.

Imagine this machine fits on your desk, imagine you can build it for about 400 €. Imagine 
it is fully open source, starting from firmware, trough control software to hardware. 
Imagine this machine can partially replicate itself.

Sci-Fi? Nope. A real thing - RepRap 3D printer. Best with Fedora!

## GNURadio, HAM
### Name: Jaroslav Škarvada
### Room: Room B
### Time: Sat Apr 6 2013, 14:00 - 15:00 CEST

GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that
provides signal processing blocks to implement software defined radios
(SDR). It can be used together with various external RF hardware or
without hardware in a simulation-like environment. This talk will be
short introduction to GNU Radio and available RF hardware including
practical examples with USRP, Funcube dongle and RTL-2832 based TV
dongle.

## Workshop: Qt/QML & Cascades
### Name: Daniel Vrátil
### Room: Room B
### Time: Sat Apr 6 2013, 15:00 - 17:00 CEST

BlackBerry 10 is a new mobile platform which is primarily using Qt and QML and 
a custom set of QML components called Cascades. In this workshop we will shortly 
introduce Qt and QML and will cover basic concepts of Cascades. At the end we 
will create and deploy a simple Cascades application.

## ARM & Fedora
### Name: Pavel Tišnovský
### Room: Room A
### Time: Sun Apr 7 2013, 14:30 - 15:30 CEST

In this talk basic information about the ARM microprocessor and ARM architecture 
will be presented: history of ARM processors, introduction to various ARM instruction 
sets (including Thumb mode). The most important change in the ARM world - evolution 
from the "classic" 32bit ARM architecture to ARM64 - will be discussed too.

## Workshop: Writing standalone Qt & Python applications for Android
### Name: Martin Kolman
### Room: Room B
### Time: Sun Apr 7 2013, 15:30 - 16:30 CEST

While Python and Qt (by the Necessitas project) are both already available for 
Android for some time, an easy method enabling development of combined Python & Qt
applications that can be distributed as standalone APKs was not readily available 
until now.

In the first part of the workshop I'll shortly introduce how Qt, Python, PySide 
(Qt bindings for Python), Python for Android together produce an Android APK that 
can be easily installed on most current Android devices.

In the second part I'll introduce the powerful pydroid framework developed by Aaron 
Richiger, that enables very easy development, deployment, debugging and packaging 
of many types of Python & Qt applications (QWidget, QML, Qt Components) both using 
the Necessitas QtCreator IDE and just from the command line.
