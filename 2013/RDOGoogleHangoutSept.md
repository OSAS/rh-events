## OpenStack Networking with Neutron and RDO
### Name: Dave Neary
### Time: Tuesday September 24, 12:00pm EST

Hangout: <https://plus.google.com/events/cph9aq3a6ag1lb17g3gsvaiiljg>

A short overview of networking in OpenStack, the relative roles of
Neutron, OVS, a little bit on where OpenDaylight and OpenFlow fit into
the equation, and then a walk-through of the basic L2 & L3 workflows
that people usually want to do in Neutron, and work through a couple of
common situations where people have trouble ("Can't ping my VM, can't
associate floating IP") and the tools you might use to debug and fix
these problems.

We'll have a lot of time for Q&A, and we will have OpenStack networking
experts from Red Hat on-hand to help with those.
