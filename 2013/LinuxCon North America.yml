talks:

- title: Everything I Know About the Cloud, I Learned From Game of Thrones
  speaker: Joe Brockmeier
  start: 2013-09-18 00:00 EDT
  end: 2013-09-18 00:00 EDT
  description: |
    George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series, and the HBO
    television series, makes for great entertainment — if a little bloody
    and short on happy endings. Though the “Game of Thrones” characters
    inhabit a universe that hasn’t even seen gunpowder yet, a lot of the
    lessons learned in GoT also apply to building, deploying, and
    maintaining an IaaS cloud. This talk will take a humorous approach, but
    also give attendees some crucial insights into moving from traditional
    IT to cloud computing.

- title: It Was Never About Innovation
  speaker: John Mark Walker
  start: 2013-09-15 20:35 EDT
  end: 2013-09-15 20:35 EDT
  description: |
    Cloud computing as an industry phenomenon is built almost entirely on
    open source pieces, but ironically (or perhaps, perversely) is used to
    create proprietary services. This talk shows how the four software
    freedoms achieved a more level playing field for software users and
    developers and provided a solid foundation on which innovation
    flourished. Innovation was an interesting by-product, not something
    pursued. Unfortunately, the four software freedoms are not enough to
    compel open cloud services. The lessons learned from open source should
    be used to achieve a level playing field in cloud computing.

- title: OpenStack Performance & Scale
  speaker: Mark Wagner
  start: 2013-09-15 21:35 EDT
  end: 2013-09-15 21:35 EDT
  description: |
    Review performance and scale testing of OpenStack by the Red Hat
    Performance team. This will include management platform performance and
    individual node performance. Also discuss the tools, methodologies, and
    strategies used in the testing. Using test data from the Performance
    Lab, Mark will demonstrate tunings that improve performance and show
    where these tunings will be applied to improve out-of-the-box
    performance. He will also reveal tips and tricks for achieving higher
    density.

- title: Resource Management with Systemd
  speaker: Lennart Poettering
  start: 2013-09-16 01:10 EDT
  end: 2013-09-16 01:10 EDT
  description: |
    Resource management is highly relevant on both large servers (where many
    resources need to be distributed among an even higher number of
    consumers to get the maximum out of the invested infrastructure) and on
    small embedded devices (where few resources need to be distributed among
    many consumers). Newer systemd versions support resource management
    out-of-the-box, as first-class functionality of service management. In
    this talk we will show you how to make use of it. We will tell you how
    to dynamically assign resource limits to running services and virtual
    machines and how to reliably determine the current resource usage of
    your services and virtual machines. We will introduce you to new
    concepts such as "Slices" which you can use to create arbitrary resource
    partition hierarchies. And we will give you a bit of background on what
    actually happens on the lower level.

- title: Using OpenStack Heat Autoscaling
  speaker: Steven Dake
  start: 2013-09-16 02:10 EDT
  end: 2013-09-16 02:10 EDT
  description: |
    OpenStack Heat provides autoscaling functionality for dynamically
    growing and shrinking compute power to meet the needs of a scale-out web
    application. In this speaking session, a brief introduction to Heat is
    provided, an autoscaling implementation lifecycle is recommended, and
    some brief thoughts on future OpenStack Heat autoscaling direction are
    explained.

- title: Per-CPU Facilities in the Linux Kernel
  speaker: Tejun Heo
  start: 2013-09-16 02:10 EDT
  end: 2013-09-16 02:10 EDT
  description: |
    With even small devices having multi-core processors and NUMA
    configuration being the norm in the server space, reducing cross-CPU
    traffic is one of the major optimization points, and per-cpu data
    structures are very effective and well-established way to achieve it.
    The Linux kernel has extensive per-cpu facilities which are still
    evolving. This presentation looks briefly at the evolution of per-cpu
    facilities in the kernel and goes through several examples of per-cpu
    constructs and their usages.

- title: Navigating the LEgal Minefields of Fedora
  speaker: Tom Callaway
  start: 2013-09-16 03:10 EDT
  end: 2013-09-16 03:10 EDT
  description: |
    Fedora has a commitment to Free Software at its core, but the universe
    is not so simple. Backed by Red Hat, Fedora presents a significant
    target for legal threats and has to be ever vigilant to minimize risk
    while still providing the latest and greatest in functionality. In this
    talk, I will discuss some of the framework that Fedora has established
    to navigate the legal minefields present in our industry, including:

    * Copyright Licensing
    * Software Patents
    * Trademarks
    * Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)

- title: Enterprise Identity Management with Open Source Tools
  speaker: 
  start: 2013-09-16 03:10 EDT
  end: 2013-09-16 03:10 EDT
  description: |
    The talk will cover the FreeIPA and partially SSSD projects introducing
    FreeIPA as the first fully functional open source centralized
    authentication and identity management solution comparable to Active
    Directory in its capabilities but focusing primarily on the identity
    management needs of the Linux and UNIX client systems.

- title: Private Could SLA
  speaker: Greg Padgett
  start: 2013-09-16 21:45 EDT
  end: 2013-09-16 21:45 EDT
  description: |
    Maintaining QoS in cloud computing requires host-level monitoring and
    policy enforcement. In order to be able to scale up large setups, a
    host-level agent is needed to supervise and dynamically handle the VMs
    resource consumption based on the SLA policy. In this session we'll take
    oVirt as an example of private cloud with a need for SLA. We'll look
    into SLA challenges of the cloud, and then at MoM as a host-level
    enforcement agent. As an agent we'll review MoM's integration with VDSM
    and policies. Participants will be able to get insights cloud SLA
    challenges, ans some resolutions such as memory overcommitment in
    hypervisors.

- title: Build Your Own PaaS, Just Like Red Hat's OpenShift
  speaker: Diane Mueller
  start: 2013-09-17 01:10 EDT
  end: 2013-09-17 01:10 EDT
  description: |
    It's finally here! OpenShift is built on open source and here's your
    chance to learn how to take the code and projects that power OpenShift
    to build your own PaaS. Come check out this session with Grant Shipley
    from the OpenShift team to learn where to download, how to install, and
    how to configure and deploy onto your local machine(s). We'll cover the
    fundamentals of how to deploy apps onto your PaaS to make it do
    something useful for you. We'll cover ways to extend your PaaS by adding
    support for customized middleware, databases, frameworks and languages.

- title: 'Raspberry Pi: Getting Started and Creative Applications'
  speaker: Ruth Suehle

    The Raspberry Pi was designed as an inexpensive device to teach kids
    Python. It's become a device of choice for hardware tinkerers and
    hackers of all sorts of experience levels to integrate a fully
    functional Linux computer into their projects. I'll give you some
    inspiration with a few project ideas. Then I'll start with the basic,
    most important Pi tricks, like making sure you have the right SD card
    and that you've chosen the best distro for the job you intend to do up
    through some more challenging problems, like what happens when you need
    to build a cross-compiler or a custom kernel. Not that those things are
    crucial to having fun with a Pi, and whether you're new to the board or
    already used it to power your home automation system, you'll learn a few
    new ideas in this session.

- title: 'Storage Management: Pulling Together Management Across the Cloud and Bare
    Metal'
  speaker: Ric Wheeler
  start: 2013-09-17 03:10 EDT
  end: 2013-09-17 03:10 EDT
  description: |
    Managing storage resources in Linux has traditionally been the realm of
    storage teams with deep expertise in the magic of external and internal
    RAID arrays and external filers. Technologies like hyper-scale,
    openstack and virtualization make it harder than ever to provision,
    manage during run time and repair storage. This talk will give a
    detailed overview of several upstream projects that are working on
    providing all of these environments, as well as traditional bare metal
    servers, an easy to use way to set up, run and debug storage and file
    systems. Status updates on the component projects and their roadmaps
    will also be shared.

- title: Linux Kernel Developer Panel
  speaker: Ric Wheeler, Greg Kroah-Hartman
  start: 2013-09-17 19:35 EDT

    We take this opportunity at the CloudOpen Event to bring together
    networking experts from OpenStack and CloudStack to discuss their most
    pressing problems in virtual networking with some of the leaders of the
    OpenDaylight SDN Controlller project. OpenDaylight should become a key
    foundational component of modern Cloud deploymemnts bringing much needed
    flexibility, features, and performance to both virtual networks, and the
    physical networks on which they reside. Bring your questions and
    suggestions on how OpenDaylight should evolve to best serve cloud
    environments in service providers and enterprises alike.

- title: How Platform-as-a-Serivice Benefits More Than Developers

    PaaS has rightly been celebrated as a way to increase developer
    productivity and thereby help companies get the new applications and
    services they need online (and making money) faster. But PaaS goes
    beyond developers and beyond dev/test. Efficient application
    multi-tenancy and auto-scaling are also key features for production
    environments. Furthermore, PaaS also means that platform changes can
    happen without affecting developers, a big win for architects and
    procurement officers. In short, PaaS is for everyone. This session will
    help attendees understand how the PaaS landscape is evolving to provide
    solutions with appeal across many facets of the IT organization and
    beyond. It will touch on key technical enablers that are making this
    possible but will focus predominantly on how organizations are using
    PaaS today and the benefits that they are seeing by doing so.
