## Keynote Address: Cultivating Community: Best Practices for Overcoming Challenges to Collaboration
### Name: Leslie Hawthorn
### Time: TBD, check back for more details

The technical benefits of the open source model are widely known: a wider pool of talent than any one company could bring to bear on a particular problem, the ability to focus more energy on key product differentiators rather than creating and maintaining foundational elements, and higher quality source code. From a technical perspective, open source has triumphed and ushered in a new era of development practices and methodologies that allow disparate groups with different and, often, conflicting agendas to work together effectively, creating better works, faster. Despite its successes, the practice of open source development remains challenging in many of its social aspects: achieving the best possible consensus amongst various parties, navigating the cultural differences inherent in working with a global team and dealing with contentious contributors. To put it another way, software and hardware are 'easy', people are difficult.

Drawing on years of experience working with hundreds of open source projects, Leslie Hawthorn will explore best practices for cultivating community cohesion, including: 

* Creating consensus among different groups
* Mitigating conflicts that arise due to different cultural norms
* Smoothing the waters after hard conversations and argument
