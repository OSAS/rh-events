  Behind every amazing tech innovation today are developers – these unique creatures that are able to turn coffee into software, using code as their primary instrument. Since 2015, once a year, on a (hopefully) sunny day, the global community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”.
