  The modern challenge for information security is the duality of its tasks: How to improve security posture and resource efficiency at the same time? Should legacy systems be protected at the cost of new security technology adoption? What are the boundaries of security responsibility between the company and its employees? What is the impact of legislation and regulations on the organizationâ€™s security? Those management-level challenges are reflected in technological challenges: protection of an ever-increasing number of mobile devices, data leak protection in the age of cloud, and big data to name a few. The IDC Security Roadshow 2019 will discuss these and many other of today's and tomorrow's security challenges.
