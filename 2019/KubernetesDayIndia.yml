  Kubernetes Day is a single day, single track event that brings together local and international experts to engage developers interested in Kubernetes and related cloud native technologies. Run by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which hosts Kubernetes, the event is targeted at regions with large numbers of developers who cannot necessarily travel to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon events in Europe, China, and North America.
