  Hyperledger Bootcamp is where we help get community members up to speed on how to contribute. Most of the participants are fairly new and we understand that contributing to your first project can be a be daunting. This process take the fear out of the process. For existing contributors and maintainer, this is the ideal place to recruit more help for your project or group.
