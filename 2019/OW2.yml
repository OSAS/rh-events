  Free software was defined a generation ago by the freedom to use, read, modify and redistribute the code. Yet these four simple rules have had the power to change the software industry. What appeared as an efficient techno-legal construct based on generous values of sharing and openness to efficiently collaborate on software development efforts has become open source software, a business model and a vehicle of collaborative innovation. OW2con’19 will concentrate on the many faces of open source software, its journey between values and value.
