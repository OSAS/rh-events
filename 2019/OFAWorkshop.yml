  The OpenFabrics Alliance (OFA) is committed to accelerating the development of high performance fabrics. The annual OFA Workshop, returning this year to Austin, TX, is a premier means of fostering collaboration among those who develop fabrics, deploy fabrics, and create applications that rely on fabrics. It is the only event of its kind where fabric developers and users can discuss emerging fabric technologies, collaborate on future industry requirements, and address problems that exist today.
