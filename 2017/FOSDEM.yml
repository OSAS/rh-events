- title: 'A discussion of Fedora''s legal state: this is why i drink.'
  speaker: Tom Callaway
  start: 2017-02-04 17:05 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 17:30 CET
  room: H.1301 / Cornil
  track: Legal and Policy Issues
  description: |
    Tom Callaway, the Fedora Legal chair, will talk about the past,
    present, and future of licensing and legal issues in the Fedora
    community. Tom is not a lawyer, nor does he play one on TV, but he does
    consult with lawyers, and occasionally, go drinking with them. Bring
    your questions, and he'll do his best to answer them. I am not a
    lawyer, so nothing in my presentation should be (or could be) construed
    as legal advice.

- title: 'Fortification vs memcheck: making GCc/glibc fortification and Valgrind memcheck
    work better together'
  speaker: Mark Wielaard
  start: 2017-02-04 15:00 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 16:00 CET
  room: AW1.124
  track: Valgrind
  description: |
    gcc/glibc support fortification of some functions by defining
    _FORTIFY_SOURCE. This inserts some compile and runtime buffer overflow
    checks for selected glibc functions. These checks have no or very
    little runtime overhead and work on the object level (the compiler
    provides/proofs the size of the object buffer size). valgrind memcheck
    provides similar memory buffer overflow checks. These checks don't need
    any compiler help (you won't have to rebuild your code). But they have
    a much higher runtime overhead. They also work on a different level.
    valgrind memcheck doesn't know anything about the objects the user is
    manipulation but has knowledge of all memory blocks allocated. Lets
    explore how these different mechanisms work and how we can make them
    work better together.

- title: 'Modularity & generational core: the future of Fedora?'
  speaker: Petr Šabata, Adam Samalik
  start: 2017-02-04 14:30 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 15:20 CET
  room: K.4.601
  track: Distributions
  description: |
    Following the progress of the Modularity initiative and Factory 2.0
    developments in Fedora, it's about time we define what the next,
    modular operating system should look like, focusing on the developer’s
    point of view.

- title: Managing container infrastructure
  speaker: Piotr Kliczewski
  start: 2017-02-04 10:30 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 10:55 CET
  room: UB2.252A / Lameere
  track: Virtualisation and IaaS
  description: |
    During this presentation we will see how to manage infrastructure which
    is used to run containers. We will see how to use reliable vms
    provisioned by ovirt and run openshift containers on them by using
    single management UI (manageiq) with ansible modules.

- title: 'The next generation: certainty in shared storage environments'
  speaker: Adam Litke
  start: 2017-02-04 12:00 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 12:25 CET
  room: UB2.252A / Lameere
  track: Virtualisation and IaaS
  description: |
    In oVirt datacenter virtualization environments, a manager directs
    hosts to initiate operations to shared storage. These operations create
    or remove volumes, copy data between volumes, create or merge
    snapshots, and various other actions related to virtual machine
    storage. For efficiency and balance these operations should be
    distributed across multiple hosts and run in parallel when possible.
    Maintaining reliability under real world conditions requires careful
    management and resilient algorithms. This talk will introduce some of
    the problems that can arise including: dropped communications,
    scheduling conflicts, and host or storage array failure. Next, a
    solution to these problems using shared storage locking, atomic
    operations, volume generations, and forensic analysis of the storage
    will be presented. Through step by step examples, the audience will
    understand how the proposed solution can solve all of the outlined
    problems.

- title: Pet-VMs and containers united?
  speaker: Roman Mohr

    How do you integrate containers in your IaaS? In a VM based IaaS
    environment, introducing containers can be a painful experience. Most
    likely you end up running containers inside VMs to reuse existing
    infrastructure, or you start dividing your data-center into a
    container- and a VM-world. Either way, you have two management
    solutions and non optimal resource management. But what if we put VMs
    inside containers? Would such a copernican revolution give us some
    benefits? This talk covers our research around using Kubernetes as a
    virtual machines cluster manager.

- title: 'QEMU: internal APIs and conflicting world views (how abstractions indide
    QEMU (don''t) work together)'
  speaker: Eduardo Habkost
  start: 2017-02-04 13:15 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 13:55 CET
  room: UB2.252A / Lameere
  track: Virtualisation and IaaS
  description: |
    QEMU is an open source machine emulator and virtualizer written in C.
    Over time it has evolved multiple interfaces to interact with the
    outside world, and multiple internal APIs and abstractions to model and
    keep track of data. The talk will be a review of some of the challenges
    and trade-offs involved in making those abstractions work together.

- title: Improving your virtualization development workflow with lago
  speaker: Rafael Martins
  start: 2017-02-04 15:30 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 16:10 CET
  room: UB2.252A / Lameere
  track: Virtualisation and IaaS
  description: |
    Lago is an ad-hoc virtual framework which helps you build virtualized
    environments on your server or laptop for various use cases. It creates
    and orchestrates virtual machines that can be used to run test suites
    and allow a developer to quickly test his code change on non-trivial
    flows such as live migration even before starting the CI process. In
    this session, we will walk through the usage of Lago in the oVirt
    project and how it can be extended to assist virtualization developers.

- title: '20 years of Linux virtual memory: from simple server workloads to cloud
    virtualization'
  speaker: Andrea Arcangeli
  start: 2017-02-04 16:15 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 16:55 CET
  room: UB2.252A / Lameere
  track: Virtualisation and IaaS
  description: |
    Andrea will provide a high level perspective of the most notable
    milestones in the long term evolution of the Linux Virtual Memory and
    Virtualization subsystems. In addition, Andrea will explore recent
    advances in Memory Management related to the KVM Virtualization
    Hypervisor, such as NUMA balancing, THP, KSM and userfaultfd/postcopy
    live migration. Andrea will cover best practices, providing the
    audience with an understanding of when and how to leverage these
    features in their environments.

- title: 'VM: hey VM, can i share a host with you? (affinity rules in a virtual cluster)'
  speaker: Martin Sivák
  start: 2017-02-04 17:00 CET

    The workloads and scenarios for virtual machines grow more complex
    every year. So do the interactions, availability, and performance
    requirements. All that requires the administrators to carefully plan
    where to start the VMs that depend on each other and/or specific hosts.

    This talk will present the concepts that allow the administrator to
    express the rules for affinity between virtual machines and between
    virtual machines and hosts to form complex relationships that will
    cover for example:

    - licensing rules - limiting group of VMs to only use certain hosts
    - overhead - web + database VMs running together
    - performance - eg. storage VMs running on hosts with better IO
    performance
    - failover recovery - VMs returning to “their” hosts
    - reservation - There is place for only one of us!

    oVirt is an open source project for managing virtual data centers that
    will now help the administrator with exactly the above tasks. We have
    introduced the virtual machine affinity feature in the past and a huge
    improvement in that area is coming right now.

    And the best part is that all this works in a fully dynamic environment
    with automatic conflict resolution and no manual management of host
    pinning rules, saving the administrator his precious time.

- title: 'Using nvdimm under KVM: applications of persistent memory in virtualization'
  speaker: Stefan Hajnoczi
  start: 2017-02-04 17:45 CET
  end: 2017-02-04 18:10 CET
  room: UB2.252A / Lameere

    The introduction of non-volatile memory changes how applications,
    databases, and virtual machines will work in the future. NVDIMM is not
    simply a faster block device. Programs can avoid block I/O entirely and
    use byte-addressable NVDIMM to benefit from the performance
    characteristics of RAM. This requires new storage APIs that
    applications must use instead of traditional block I/O.

    These new programs run successfully inside KVM virtual machines thanks
    to the vNVDIMM support already available in QEMU. Virtualization offers
    additional options for managing and using NVDIMM beyond what is
    available on bare metal.

    This talk covers the NVDIMM programming model and how KVM virtual
    machines can use NVDIMM for faster I/O, reduced memory footprint, and
    faster boot times.
