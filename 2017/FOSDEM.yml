    Tom Callaway, the Fedora Legal chair, will talk about the past,
    present, and future of licensing and legal issues in the Fedora
    community. Tom is not a lawyer, nor does he play one on TV, but he does
    consult with lawyers, and occasionally, go drinking with them. Bring
    your questions, and he'll do his best to answer them. I am not a
    lawyer, so nothing in my presentation should be (or could be) construed
    as legal advice.

    Thermostat is a monitoring and management tool for Java deployments,
    allowing users to measure and monitor a host of different performance
    aspects of their Java applications. Available metrics range from raw
    CPU and memory usage to operation of the Garbage Collector and JIT
    compiler through to thread activity and method call/heap profiles.
    Thermostat provides a GUI view of activity of local and distributed
    JVMs in a live-view or, alternatively, offline for after-the-fact
    analysis.

    What Thermostat cannot do on its own is track events and record
    statistics that are specific to a given Java application, at least not
    unless the application co-operates with it, for example by publishing
    JMX statistics that Thermostat can read, persist and display in its
    GUI. However, that's about to change thanks to work Thermostat
    developers have been doing to integrate Byteman into Thermostat.

    Byteman is a tool which can be used to modify the behaviour of Java
    programs by injecting extra Java code almost anywhere in the program.
    You don't need to recompile your program or even prepare it in advance
    in order for this to work. You can specify changes to the program on
    the command line but, what is more amazing, you can actually use
    Byteman to change the way a program runs after startup while it is
    still running.

    In this talk we will show how Thermostat can collect and visualize
    metrics with Byteman's help in order to better understand a specific
    performance issue in a Java application.

    Garbage Collection (GC) liberates the programmer from having to call
    malloc and free. More importantly GC saves the programmer from having
    to debug their mistakes when using malloc and free. Unfortunately the
    details of how GC works are often a black box. This talk will start
    with a tour of all of the GC algorithms currently available in OpenJDK.
    We'll discuss how they work, their strengths and weaknesses, and which
    class of applications they were developed for. We'll work our way
    through serial gc, parallel gc, concurrent mark and sweep, and g1.
    We'll make the case for why we need all of them and just one more GC
    algorithm, Shenandoah.

    Shenandoah is a parallel and concurrent GC algorithm designed for
    applications with 100gb+ heaps and tight pause time constraints. It's
    the first GC algorithm targeting OpenJDK which compacts the live
    objects while the Java threads are running. We'll describe the
    algorithm itself, the implementation details, and the optimizations
    needed to achieve good performance. We'll present performance numbers
    and give a demo that visualizes Shenandoah.

    Ruby's Strings aggregate a collection of bytes and an encoding,
    allowing for IO to avoid transcoding, regular expressions to execute
    against raw bytes, and 7-bit strings to be compactly represented. Only
    the last item has been adopted by Java. To make matters worse, most
    Java APIs depend on Java's string representation, making them
    incompatible with alternative languages like Ruby. We'll explore the
    advantages of Ruby's string compared to Java's and discuss options for
    improving Java's string support in the future.

  description: |
    gcc/glibc support fortification of some functions by defining
    _FORTIFY_SOURCE. This inserts some compile and runtime buffer overflow
    checks for selected glibc functions. These checks have no or very
    little runtime overhead and work on the object level (the compiler
    provides/proofs the size of the object buffer size). valgrind memcheck
    provides similar memory buffer overflow checks. These checks don't need
    any compiler help (you won't have to rebuild your code). But they have
    a much higher runtime overhead. They also work on a different level.
    valgrind memcheck doesn't know anything about the objects the user is
    manipulation but has knowledge of all memory blocks allocated. Lets
    explore how these different mechanisms work and how we can make them
    work better together.

    There are many IoT dashboards out on the web, most will require network
    connection to a server far far away, and use non standard protocols. We
    will show how to combine free software tools and protocols from the
    worlds of IT monitoring, Industrial control and IoT to create simple
    yet robust dashboards.

    Modbus [1] is a serial communication protocol developed in 1979 for use
    with programmable logic controllers (PLCs). In simple terms, it is a
    method used for transmitting information over serial lines between
    electronic devices., it’s openly published, royalty-free, simple and
    robust.

    Many industrial controllers can speak Modbus, we can also teach “hobby”
    devices like Arduino boards and ESP8266 to speak Modbus [2]. Reliable,
    robust and simple free software Modbus client [3] will be used to
    acquire the metrics from our device, then the metrics will be collected
    [6][7] and sent to Hawkular and Grafana [8] to store and visualize our
    data.

    Next Generation Config Mgmt

    A presentation about a next gen config management tool, and the
    specific problems this project solves.

    Three of the main design features of the tool include: \* Parallel
    execution \* Event driven mechanism \* Distributed architecture

    This talk will demo a prototype I've built that implements these ideas
    and which is written in golang. I will start by presenting an
    introduction to the tool. I will then demo the new features that were
    added since the project was introduced. This will include the automatic
    grouping, automatic elastic etcd clustering and remote execution
    features. I will finally share some of the future planned designs for
    the tool.

    An introductory blog post on the subject is available.
    https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/next-generation-configuration-mgmt/
    Attendees are encouraged to read it before the talk if they are
    interested!

    Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to be given at
    15:00. The talk originally in this slot, "Puppet Catalog Diffs in
    TheForeman" by Greg Sutcliffe will now take place at 15:00.

  track: Virtualisation and IaaS
  description: |
    In oVirt datacenter virtualization environments, a manager directs
    hosts to initiate operations to shared storage. These operations create
    or remove volumes, copy data between volumes, create or merge
    snapshots, and various other actions related to virtual machine
    storage. For efficiency and balance these operations should be
    distributed across multiple hosts and run in parallel when possible.
    Maintaining reliability under real world conditions requires careful
    management and resilient algorithms. This talk will introduce some of
    the problems that can arise including: dropped communications,
    scheduling conflicts, and host or storage array failure. Next, a
    solution to these problems using shared storage locking, atomic
    operations, volume generations, and forensic analysis of the storage
    will be presented. Through step by step examples, the audience will
    understand how the proposed solution can solve all of the outlined
    problems.

    How do you integrate containers in your IaaS? In a VM based IaaS
    environment, introducing containers can be a painful experience. Most
    likely you end up running containers inside VMs to reuse existing
    infrastructure, or you start dividing your data-center into a
    container- and a VM-world. Either way, you have two management
    solutions and non optimal resource management. But what if we put VMs
    inside containers? Would such a copernican revolution give us some
    benefits? This talk covers our research around using Kubernetes as a
    virtual machines cluster manager.

    The workloads and scenarios for virtual machines grow more complex
    every year. So do the interactions, availability, and performance
    requirements. All that requires the administrators to carefully plan
    where to start the VMs that depend on each other and/or specific hosts.

    This talk will present the concepts that allow the administrator to
    express the rules for affinity between virtual machines and between
    virtual machines and hosts to form complex relationships that will
    cover for example:

    - licensing rules - limiting group of VMs to only use certain hosts
    - overhead - web + database VMs running together
    - performance - eg. storage VMs running on hosts with better IO
    performance
    - failover recovery - VMs returning to “their” hosts
    - reservation - There is place for only one of us!

    oVirt is an open source project for managing virtual data centers that
    will now help the administrator with exactly the above tasks. We have
    introduced the virtual machine affinity feature in the past and a huge
    improvement in that area is coming right now.

    And the best part is that all this works in a fully dynamic environment
    with automatic conflict resolution and no manual management of host
    pinning rules, saving the administrator his precious time.

    The introduction of non-volatile memory changes how applications,
    databases, and virtual machines will work in the future. NVDIMM is not
    simply a faster block device. Programs can avoid block I/O entirely and
    use byte-addressable NVDIMM to benefit from the performance
    characteristics of RAM. This requires new storage APIs that
    applications must use instead of traditional block I/O.

    These new programs run successfully inside KVM virtual machines thanks
    to the vNVDIMM support already available in QEMU. Virtualization offers
    additional options for managing and using NVDIMM beyond what is
    available on bare metal.

    This talk covers the NVDIMM programming model and how KVM virtual
    machines can use NVDIMM for faster I/O, reduced memory footprint, and
    faster boot times.

    Now, when many IT-related services are delegated to external parties,
    government, medical, financial, and other organizations need tight
    tracking of what users and administrators do on their critical systems.
    Up to recording everything they see on the screen, the commands they
    execute, and files they access.

    In this presentation Nikolai Kondrashov will review available solutions
    for user session recording, open-source and otherwise, their benefits
    and shortcomings, and will present a new effort to create an integrated
    Open-Source solution.

    While there are many capable solutions for session recording, which can
    centrally collect, search and playback sessions, there is no such
    open-source code. The best we have is jump servers with script(1), or
    sudo I/O logging, all manually set up. This presentation will show an
    approach that would meet the needs of the modern enterprise.

    The presentation will include a demo of a user session and accompanying
    data being recorded, stored centrally, inspected and played back.

    The intended audience is developers of security, identity and policy
    management systems, as well as system administrators and security
    officers responsible for maintaining critical systems and preventing
    insider attacks.

    What does it take to implement continuous integration-style automated
    testing into a mailing list-driven software project? Not a lot,
    actually. In this talk, we demonstrate how a simple but easily scaled
    testing system can be implemented for a such a project through the
    combination of Patchwork, the web-based patch tracking system, and open
    source CI tools such as Jenkins.

    On a cloud computing environment it is often required to use a user's
    smart card on a remote server. That is, insert a smart card locally
    (windows or linux client), ssh to a server, and then utilize the smart
    card to 'sudo' application or to a TLS application, or to 'kinit' to
    obtain a kerberos ticket. Other operating systems such as windows
    provide this functionality via USB-pass-through. The purpose of this
    talk, is to describe where we are, and what we provide for that problem.

    The Transport Layer Protocol is becoming more and more complex. With
    more than 4 versions deployed side-by-side, the complexity of servers
    is increasing even faster.

    To fight this, we've started to work on TLS test framework that
    hopefully we'll later be able to turn into a dedicated TLS protocol
    fuzzer. Currently we have a battery of tests for obscure and not so
    obscure bugs as well as general RFC compliance.

    Increased uses of cryptography in web environments, particularly
    authentication, have driven a set of new RFCs: JSON Object Signing and
    Encryption. While these standard data formats have dominated web-based
    applications, they also have further applicability in a wide variety of
    non-web contexts. This talk will introduce you to José, a plug-able,
    open source C implementation of these RFCs which provides both an API
    for direct integration and a usable command-line interface. We will
    discuss the techniques that we used to keep our API usable across all
    the possible input parameters and show example of how you can implement
    José in your own infrastructure. We will also discuss some of our plans
    for the future, including how you can help contribute.

    The world is not perfect and network failures do happen. Complaining
    about instability might not always be enough. Especially when your
    system depends on multiple networked services and each of them is on a
    critical path to the final result.

    This talk will follow a real story of an attempt to implement network
    errors handling by retries functionality that is inside urllib3 and
    requests Python libraries. More importantly we will simulate poor
    network conditions on a local machine using Linux Network Emulator and
    then will reason on how effective the attempt was and what can be
    further improved.

    This is a proper treatment the networked systems should get when they
    are designed, developed and tested. And it is great that all the tools
    necessary are already there in most popular Linux distributions.

    Containers are great in terms of application packaging and delivery,
    but there’s a lot of noise in the space. But when it comes to
    multi-container applications, most production setups use advanced
    container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes, Openshift,
    Mesos/Marathon, which are not that developer friendly.

    Developers prefer docker-compose for its simplicity. This talk will
    showcase our ongoing efforts at Red Hat, Skippbox and Google to bridge
    this gap between deploying containers in development to production, and
    the need to standardize a multiple container definition spec which
    works seamlessly across different environments and container
    orchestration platforms.

    OpenShift version 3 is an open-source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
    based on docker-formatted container images and the Kubernetes project.
    Kubernetes is an open-source project for orchestration, deployment
    automation, auto-scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    OpenShift combines all of the benefits of docker and Kubernetes and
    adds features like automatic image building, a local docker registry,
    storage integration, networking, and Continous Integration (CI) tools
    such as Jenkins, to deliver a platform for Continuous Delivery (CD).
    Simply put, just bring your application code and OpenShift will build
    the required Docker images and run the application on OpenShift with
    Kubernetes. OpenShift is also ideal for deploying the microservices
    that containers make so easy to implement.

    When things go wrong in production, it can be necessary to troubleshoot
    problems where they occur, instead of in a development environment. In
    those situations having a working knowledge of GDB, GDB Python
    Extensions, and strace is very helpful. You will see some simple
    techniques to get insight into those situations. This talk outlines
    several techniques for connecting to an already running, "stuck", or
    deadlocked Python process using GDB for debugging.

    During the talk, we will:

    - inspect the current state of threads with
    - use and demo the GDB macros for Python
    - inspect a locally running process and a core dump collected from a
    remote machine
    - use strace to gather system call information about a process
    - discuss the SIGTRAP handler as a proactive way to make rpdb available
    in production.

    I have had to debug several hard-to-find bugs that were very infrequent
    deadlocks using Python. Furthermore it was happening on remote machines
    I could not have network access to. This technique was invaluable in
    those situations.

    Everything is in the abstract

    Working on optimizations is a task more complex than expected on the
    first look. Any optimization must be measured to make sure that, in
    practice, it speeds up the application task. Problem: it is very hard
    to obtain stable benchmark results.

    The stability of a benchmark (performance measurement) is essential to
    be able to compare two versions of the code and compute the difference
    (faster or slower?). An unstable benchmark is useless, and is a risk of
    giving a false result when comparing performance which could lead to
    bad decisions.

    I'm gonna show you the Python project "perf" which helps to launch
    benchmarks, but also to analyze them: compute the mean and the standard
    deviation on multiple runs, render an histogram to visualize the
    probability curve, compare between multiple results, run again a
    benchmark to collect more samples, etc.

    The use case is to measure small isolated optimizations on CPython and
    make sure that they don't introduce performance regression in term of
    performance.
