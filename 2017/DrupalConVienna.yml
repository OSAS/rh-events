  The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're developers, designers, strategists, coordinators, editors, translators, and more. Each year, we meet at DrupalCamps, meetups, and other events in more than 200 countries. But once a year, our community comes together in a European city for one of our biggest events, DrupalCon. This year, from September 26-29, we'll be in Vienna.
