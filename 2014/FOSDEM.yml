  description: |-
    In the 8+ years since it was founded, the libvirt project grown to
    become the leading open source API for the management of virtualization
    hosts, with a strong focus on supporting the open source virtualization
    & container technologies, KVM, QEMU, Xen and LXC. Many people working in
    the open source virtualization management space already have an
    understanding of the core features and architecture of libvirt. This
    talk will thus focus on a selection of recently developed features and
    of some of the other important, but less well known, features of
    libvirt.

    The talk will be targeted at virtualization application developers using
    libvirt, with a bias towards those using KVM or LXC. At the end of the
    talk the audience will better understand how to take advantage of
    libvirt for their development needs.

    show samples of VM scheduling plug-ins, and integrate it to a live
    setup.

- title: A Method for Distributing Applications Independent from the Distro
  speaker: Langdon White
  start: 2014-02-01 14:00 CET
  end: 2014-02-01 14:50 CET
  description: |-
    For many years the Linux distro concept has been about "inclusion of
    applications" sometimes at the detriment to co-habitating applications
    and the stability of the core OS. Much discussion has been made over the
    years about JEOS, embedded Linux, custom distros, applicance building,
    etc, but not a lot of discussion about how applications could be
    delivered such that they were more readily able to co-habitate. On a
    related note, open source applications (because distros are so
    "inclusive") are put through significant scrutiny around their design
    and deployment related to their integration with the core OS that may or
    may not make sense. The scrutiny is certainly more intense than
    proprietary software is required to undergo. This talk proposes a
    new'ish technology, Software Collections, as a method for resolution.

    CentOS has cemented a reputation as the "community enterprise operating
    system" - one that provides a reliable rebuild, but is not known for
    innovation in its own right. With the news that Red Hat and CentOS are
    joining forces, this is going to change. Here's how CentOS is planning
    to change, and how other distros can learn from our next phase.

- title: 'Fedora.NEXT: Developing the Fedora Server, Workstation and Cloud'
  speaker: Stephen Gallagher
  start: 2014-02-01 16:00 CET
  end: 2014-02-01 16:50 CET
  description: |-
    As you may or may not be aware, Fedora is transitioning from its classic
    "one-size-fits-all" approach to one where we intend to target three
    specific user types with individual products: Fedora Workstation, Fedora
    Server and Fedora Cloud. Gathering Fedora contributors at FOSDEM to work
    on the logistics around this change in direction would be a valuable
    opportunity.

- title: Anatomy of kdbus
  speaker: Lennart Poettering
  start: 2014-02-01 00:45 CET
  end: 2014-02-01 13:30 CET
  description: |-
    Linux/Unix never had a standardized high-level local IPC system. It did
    have a various IPC primitives such as AF\_UNIX sockets, FIFOs, shared
    memory or synchronization facilities. D-Bus has been an attempt (one of
    many) to implement a high-level, introspectable, secure IPC system on
    top of that, however, being designed for exchanging control data only
    shows serious performance issue when used for exchange of payload.

    In this talk we will introduce you to "kdbus", our attempt to implement
    a high-level, introspectable, multicast-capable IPC system in the Linux
    kernel, as well a matching userspace part within the system project.
    "kdbus" is designed to provide you with secure, single-copy or zero-copy
    IPC, built from the ground up with sandboxing and namespacing in mind.
    Taking inspiration from other OS-level IPC systems such as Android
    Binder, Solaris Doors, QNX IPC or Mach Ports it is our intention to make
    kdbus truly universal.

- title: Shenandoah - an ultra-low pause-time GC for OpenJDK
  speaker: Roman Kennke
  start: 2014-02-01 00:00 CET
  end: 2014-02-01 12:25 CET
  description: |-
    Current garbage collectors for OpenJDK all need to stop the application
    periodically to perform garbage collection tasks. This is a scalability
    bottleneck because those pause times are dependend on heap size.
    Shenandoah is a new garbage collector for OpenJDK, currently developed
    by Red Hat, that aims to reduce GC pause times to a minimum by
    implementing marking and object evacuation to run concurrently with
    application threads, and utilizing parallel garbage collection threads.

  description: |-
    Write once run anywhere is both a blessing and a curse. For years, the
    WORA promise has ensured a consistent, compile-free experience for JVM
    users. Unfortunately, sometimes pure-Java libraries just can't do what
    developers need done. Sometimes, you just have to go full native. The
    Java Native Runtime is a core library and suite of support libraries for
    binding and calling out to native code. I'll show how JNR is designed,
    compare code and performance with alternative approaches, and talk about
    why the JDK needs a standard FFI (foreign function interface) in Java 9.

  description: |-
    Persistent memory parts have roughly the same capacity, speed and cost
    as current DRAM, but do not lose state when the power goes out. Some of
    these parts are on the market today, more will be coming out over the
    next few years. The Linux IO and File System stack is already challenged
    in handling existing SSD devices at hundreds of thousands of IO's per
    second and these devices will be able to sustain an order of magnitude
    more IOP's.

    This talk will give an overview of what is being proposed in standards
    bodies and the Linux based solutions being proposed that will help us
    take full advantage of these new parts.

    Getting cross-platform: bringing virtualization management to the PPC
    world oVirt, the open source data center virtualization management
    solution is expanding the x86\_64 architecture support to PowerPC
    hardware, among them IBM Power processor based hosts.

    Entering PPC world raises challenges of managing mixed arch data-centers
    with the need to distinguish PPC from x86\_64 VMs. In this session we'll
    cover the main differences in virtualization needs, how we enabled the
    support for that in our management engine(a.k.a ovirt-engine)

    PPC virtualization main differences is in virtualized devices supports.
    Built around x86_64, ovirt-engine needed to expand its cluster and VMs
    provisioning to fit multi architecture, and to keep migration support
    and proper VM configuration solid for the supported operating systems.
    Since some parts are work in progress (e.g live migration) for the PPC
    VDSM, the engine has to also manage features which are not supported for
    PPC while is supported for x86_64

    To cope with a change that span various parts and components a
    repository for Operating Systems and they're hipervisor's demands was
    created along with strategy functions around the code to ensure correct
    provisions and life cycle related VM functions.

    The session will cover what is now supported (hypervisor and VM OSs),
    how we provision PPC clusters and VMs and a little deeper dive to
    explore the mechanisms which enabled this multi-platform support along
    with some code examples (yes, we're going to see some code!)

    Target audience Whoever is interested in data-center virtualization in
    general and ovirt-engine specifically, and this latest PPC support
    effort it brings.

    For several years now, oVirt manages Virtual Machines. Then came the
    question- can you run oVirt inside a VM, which in turn will be managed
    by the hosted oVirt? In this session we'll understand the intricacies of
    an egg hosting it's parent chicken. We'll cover the various aspects
    starting with installation, going through standard operations and ending
    with high-availability for the hosted engine. Participants will be able
    to get insights of this unique setup, which will save them a physical
    server (or even two), while allowing standard flows to run the same way
    they did in the past years.

  description: |-
    Join me for an architectural, developer oriented overview of (GRE and
    VXLAN) tunnels in OpenStack Networking.

    In the virtualization environment virtual machines are hosted on
    hypervisors. These VMs then obtain network connectivity via software
    switches run in the same hypervisors. Data centers that provide
    infrastructure as a service have (hopefully) multiple customers (Or
    'tenants'). As you can imagine we don't want tenants' VMs interacting
    with one another.

    VLANs are a natural approach to achieve tenant segregation. However, how
    do we maintain scalability with a growing number of hypervisors and VMs,
    when the administrator has to constantly configure the hardware switches
    manually? Is there another way?

    We all use VPNs to connect to our office resources remotely, or to
    connect two office sites into one seamless network. VPNs are essentially
    encrypted tunnels, but what are tunnels?

    Tunnels allow us to wrap packets inside more packets. In our context -
    VM traffic in exterior IP packets. That way, to the intermediate
    networking hardware, it looks like traffic between the hypervisors.
    Since the hypervisors should already be able to talk to each other, this
    makes VM connectivity a breeze!

    Let's explore how tunnels are used in the cloud as a means to achieve an
    overlay network. What is an overlay network? How does traffic flow
    between virtual machines on the same hypervisor, and on different
    hypervisors? What are the similarities between a layer 2 learning switch
    and tunnel logic in OpenStack? How does Open vSwitch fit in? Is there a
    cost to using tunnels?

    This talk will be useful to developers interested in learning about new
    networking concepts - Minimal background knowledge will be assumed.
