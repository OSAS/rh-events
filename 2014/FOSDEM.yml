    In the 8+ years since it was founded, the libvirt project grown to
    become the leading open source API for the management of virtualization
    hosts, with a strong focus on supporting the open source virtualization
    & container technologies, KVM, QEMU, Xen and LXC. Many people working in
    the open source virtualization management space already have an
    understanding of the core features and architecture of libvirt. This
    talk will thus focus on a selection of recently developed features and
    of some of the other important, but less well known, features of
    libvirt.

    The talk will be targeted at virtualization application developers using
    libvirt, with a bias towards those using KVM or LXC. At the end of the
    talk the audience will better understand how to take advantage of
    libvirt for their development needs.

  description: |-
    Xorg (the X-server) is a big and complex beast. Currently it runs as
    root as it needs root rights for various reasons. But with the latest
    systemd-logind all necessary infrastructure is in place to allow the
    server to run as a normal user and use systemd-logind to do input and
    graphics device management.

    This talk looks at the work being done to leverage this new
    infrastructure to run Xorg without root rights.

- title: A method for distributing applications independent from the distro
  speaker: Langdon White

  end: 2014-02-01 14:50 CET
  room: H.1302 (Depage)
  track: Distributions
  description: |-
    For many years the Linux distro concept has been about "inclusion of
    applications" sometimes at the detriment to co-habitating applications
    and the stability of the core OS. Much discussion has been made over the
    years about JEOS, embedded Linux, custom distros, applicance building,
    etc, but not a lot of discussion about how applications could be
    delivered such that they were more readily able to co-habitate. On a
    related note, open source applications (because distros are so
    "inclusive") are put through significant scrutiny around their design
    and deployment related to their integration with the core OS that may or
    may not make sense. The scrutiny is certainly more intense than
    proprietary software is required to undergo. This talk proposes a
    new'ish technology, Software Collections, as a method for resolution.

  description: |-
    Recently, Cisco released a software component for H264 video support
    under the BSD license. This would normally be considered Free Software,
    except for the fact that this standard is considered to be patented
    (where software patents apply). They are covering the MPEG LA licensing
    fees, but only for pre-built binaries, not for the corresponding source.
    I will discuss this issue, and why the resulting software is not only
    non-free, but does not solve any issues for distributors with a focus on
    Freedom (such as Fedora).

  description: |-
    Current garbage collectors for OpenJDK all need to stop the application
    periodically to perform garbage collection tasks. This is a scalability
    bottleneck because those pause times are dependend on heap size.
    Shenandoah is a new garbage collector for OpenJDK, currently developed
    by Red Hat, that aims to reduce GC pause times to a minimum by
    implementing marking and object evacuation to run concurrently with
    application threads, and utilizing parallel garbage collection threads.

  description: |-
    Write once run anywhere is both a blessing and a curse. For years, the
    WORA promise has ensured a consistent, compile-free experience for JVM
    users. Unfortunately, sometimes pure-Java libraries just can't do what
    developers need done. Sometimes, you just have to go full native. The
    Java Native Runtime is a core library and suite of support libraries for
    binding and calling out to native code. I'll show how JNR is designed,
    compare code and performance with alternative approaches, and talk about
    why the JDK needs a standard FFI (foreign function interface) in Java 9.

    Persistent memory parts have roughly the same capacity, speed and cost
    as current DRAM, but do not lose state when the power goes out. Some of
    these parts are on the market today, more will be coming out over the
    next few years. The Linux IO and File System stack is already challenged
    in handling existing SSD devices at hundreds of thousands of IO's per
    second and these devices will be able to sustain an order of magnitude
    more IOP's.

    This talk will give an overview of what is being proposed in standards

    Getting cross-platform: bringing virtualization management to the PPC
    world oVirt, the open source data center virtualization management
    solution is expanding the x86\_64 architecture support to PowerPC
    hardware, among them IBM Power processor based hosts.

    Entering PPC world raises challenges of managing mixed arch data-centers
    with the need to distinguish PPC from x86\_64 VMs. In this session we'll
    cover the main differences in virtualization needs, how we enabled the
    support for that in our management engine(a.k.a ovirt-engine)

    PPC virtualization main differences is in virtualized devices supports.
    Built around x86_64, ovirt-engine needed to expand its cluster and VMs
    provisioning to fit multi architecture, and to keep migration support
    and proper VM configuration solid for the supported operating systems.
    Since some parts are work in progress (e.g live migration) for the PPC
    VDSM, the engine has to also manage features which are not supported for
    PPC while is supported for x86_64

    To cope with a change that span various parts and components a
    repository for Operating Systems and they're hipervisor's demands was
    created along with strategy functions around the code to ensure correct
    provisions and life cycle related VM functions.

    The session will cover what is now supported (hypervisor and VM OSs),
    how we provision PPC clusters and VMs and a little deeper dive to
    explore the mechanisms which enabled this multi-platform support along
    with some code examples (yes, we're going to see some code!)

    Target audience Whoever is interested in data-center virtualization in
    general and ovirt-engine specifically, and this latest PPC support
    effort it brings.

    Join me for an architectural, developer oriented overview of (GRE and
    VXLAN) tunnels in OpenStack Networking.

    In the virtualization environment virtual machines are hosted on
    hypervisors. These VMs then obtain network connectivity via software
    switches run in the same hypervisors. Data centers that provide
    infrastructure as a service have (hopefully) multiple customers (Or
    'tenants'). As you can imagine we don't want tenants' VMs interacting
    with one another.

    VLANs are a natural approach to achieve tenant segregation. However, how
    do we maintain scalability with a growing number of hypervisors and VMs,
    when the administrator has to constantly configure the hardware switches
    manually? Is there another way?

    We all use VPNs to connect to our office resources remotely, or to
    connect two office sites into one seamless network. VPNs are essentially
    encrypted tunnels, but what are tunnels?

    Tunnels allow us to wrap packets inside more packets. In our context -
    VM traffic in exterior IP packets. That way, to the intermediate
    networking hardware, it looks like traffic between the hypervisors.
    Since the hypervisors should already be able to talk to each other, this
    makes VM connectivity a breeze!

    Let's explore how tunnels are used in the cloud as a means to achieve an
    overlay network. What is an overlay network? How does traffic flow
    between virtual machines on the same hypervisor, and on different
    hypervisors? What are the similarities between a layer 2 learning switch
    and tunnel logic in OpenStack? How does Open vSwitch fit in? Is there a
    cost to using tunnels?

    This talk will be useful to developers interested in learning about new
    networking concepts - Minimal background knowledge will be assumed.

    As the prominent open-source data center virtualization solution, oVirt
    relies on a powerful and easy approach to configuring a data center's
    network. By leveraging the advanced network capabilities offered by
    OpenStack Networking, oVirt's maintainers aim to bring this field even
    further, allowing data center administrators to use advanced networking
    capabilities while maintaining the simplicity of oVirt's network
    management approach.

    Developers & Users are welcome to join us in this session, and to
    discover how oVirt currently leverages OpenStack Networking, and see the
    road-map to future network virtualization in the Data Center, all using
    open source enterprise-grade software.

  track: Distributions
  description: |-
    Fedmsg, the federated message bus, is a distributed system allowing bits
    of a project's infrastructure to publish events. This lightweight
    framework provides a central place to watch the life of a project, and
    allows anyone to listen in and trigger actions when an event is
    received.

    Initially built by the Fedora Infrastructure team to uniformise
    communication between its services, the Fedmsg framework has now been
    adopted by Debian and even outside the realm of Linux distributions to
    broadcast events. All those deployments are using the same framework,
    and the same tools, fostering the ever-needed interoperability and
    collaboration between free software and open data projects.

    In this talk, we will present how fedmsg works, how it was deployed in
    the Fedora and Debian infrastructures, and some of the technical choices
    that were made during those deployments. We will also present the
    applications being developed around the bus, as well as some ideas for
    future ones.

    For developers it can often be a bit of a learning curve to learn the
    proper use of a new tool. For certain development tools the entry
    barrier can be quite high and can often discourage users. The Linux
    Tools Project aims to improve the state of C/C++ development on the
    Eclipse IDE by integrating popular tools, such as Valgrind.

    This talk is aimed at people of varying experience with the Valgrind
    tool who have never used it within the Eclipse IDE.

    Valgrind is a tool that can be used for testing but also needs to be
    tested itself as any other piece of software. This talk will focus on
    testing done before releasing new Valgrind RPM in Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux.

    Overview: - types of tests I do - what they are trying to achieve - what
    bugs I often hit - ideas I have for improvement - Q/A + Discussion
    (perhaps how to work closely with upstream)
