 KVM Forum is an annual event that presents a rare opportunity for developers and users to meet, discuss the state of Linux virtualization technology, and plan for the challenges ahead. This highly technical conference unites the developers who drive KVM development and the users who depend on KVM as part of their offerings, or to power their data centers and clouds.
