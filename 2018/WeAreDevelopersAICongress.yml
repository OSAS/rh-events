  WeAreDevelopers AI Congress Vienna will focus on human-machine interactions and will bring together two sides: The academy and the industry. We will try to answer questions such as: Can we trust computer decisions? How to deal with decisions bias? How can we improve the user experience for machine learning software? And many, many more.
