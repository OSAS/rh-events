  hackCBS 1.0 is the first-ever hackathon to be organized in any of the colleges under DU, therefore, we're expecting a huge footfall (300+) of attendees from diverse backgrounds - students, developers, designers and so on. It’s not just an event where hackers meet and hack a website or application but it’s a place for programmers, designers, and developers to come, collaborate and make their ideas into reality.
